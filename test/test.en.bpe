junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to author@@ ise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the junior doctors committee ( j@@ dc ) of the british medical association ( b@@ ma ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early september .
the j@@ dc says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to reject a contract deal agreed with the b@@ ma .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on twitter on thursday night , the j@@ dc 's chair ellen mc@@ court said the government had remained " persi@@ st@@ ently silent " on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : " in light of this , the j@@ dc executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re@@ -@@ negotiations on all of your concerns . "
in response to the government 's silence , j@@ dc ex@@ ec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of b@@ ma council to author@@ ise a rolling programme of escal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early september .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all@@ -@@ out stop@@ pages in the history of the n@@ hs .
the b@@ ma 's junior doctor leader , dr joh@@ ann mala@@ wan@@ a , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the b@@ ma had recommended .
he had told b@@ ma members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 5@@ 4,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , health secretary jeremy hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in england .
russia and turkey : an ' alliance of mis@@ fits ' ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of a st@@ . petersburg palace , i got the distinct impression that an@@ kara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but mr putin 's smile looked thin and he was hardly oo@@ zing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his " dear friend " mr putin - five times , according to one report .
i lost count .
he also pledged that relations with russia would return not just to their pre@@ -@@ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described mr erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering cool@@ ness eman@@ ating from mr putin showed that russia 's leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : turkey 's shooting down of a russian fighter plane on the syrian border .
moscow 's reaction at the time was furious .
mr putin l@@ ashed out , accusing an@@ kara of stab@@ bing moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
russian public opinion has also turned since november .
for months , state@@ -@@ controlled media conducted a staggering , all@@ -@@ out offensive against an@@ kara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like tur@@ ks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that mr erdogan 's own family has pro@@ fited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of syria controlled by the so@@ -@@ called islamic state .
he 's denied that emphatically .
but in st@@ . petersburg came the official message that it 's time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because mr putin got the apology he demanded from president erdogan .
russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for an@@ kara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ous@@ ted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million russian tourists to the turkish coast each year .
the number has slum@@ ped by almost 90 % .
as for russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they 're banking on a late@@ -@@ season rush to the mediterranean .
and even this week , state tv has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
" tourists that way , tomatoes back here , " as a report in ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i newspaper phr@@ ased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for moscow .
an@@ kara is angry with the west for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long@@ -@@ standing grudge at the snail 's pace of talks to join the eu and step in mr putin - who is keen to capit@@ alise on the chill and chip away at turkey 's ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly won bonus points with an@@ kara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that 's a given for moscow which has its own deep@@ -@@ seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glit@@ zy , seaside palace allowed russia and turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an " alliance of mis@@ fits " : two countries that feel rejected and mi@@ stre@@ ated by the west , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is syria , where moscow has recently been casting itself as peace@@ maker but where russia and turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn 't even touched on the topic .
turkey 's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while mr putin chose to under@@ line them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when nato member turkey shot down that russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
royal bank of scotland to disappear for customers outside scotland
the brand r@@ bs is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers outside scotland .
ross m@@ ce@@ wan told bbc scotland that the r@@ bs brand was associated with the bank 's global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be ba@@ iled out .
during that time , brand strate@@ gists have used ' r@@ bs ' to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from six nations rug@@ by to wim@@ ble@@ don champion andy murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
royal bank of scotland will be used with scottish customers , but will not be initi@@ alised .
in england and wales , all r@@ bs references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to nat@@ west .
the ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more promin@@ ence - c@@ out@@ ts , adam & co , drum@@ mond , and hol@@ t 's military bank .
mr m@@ ce@@ wan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in inver@@ ness@@ -@@ shire .
he told bbc scotland : " the r@@ bs brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . "
as the bank itself became a global brand , r@@ bs became the global brand .
i 'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
r@@ bs had already stated that it would not to continue its six nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
" the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we 've been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? " said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we 'd said we 're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we 've been doing , focus@@ sing on the customers needs , not our own , i think you 're seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so i think the time is right .
frankie de@@ tt@@ ori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at new@@ market on pre@@ dil@@ ection
de@@ tt@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at new@@ market takes him to 3,000 wins
jo@@ ckey frankie de@@ tt@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th british winner at new@@ market on friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by john go@@ s@@ den .
the 45@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey to reach the landmark in flat racing .
he follows sir gordon richar@@ ds , doug smith , lester pig@@ got@@ t , pat ed@@ der@@ y and willie carson .
three@@ -@@ time champion jo@@ ckey de@@ tt@@ ori , who earlier won on g@@ hay@@ y@@ ar , said : " it 's special . "
i 'm very emotional because my family are here as well
i 'm very pleased for it to have happened at new@@ market because this is where i landed 30 years ago .
it 's not a big meeting , it 's not a royal as@@ cot - it 's a mun@@ dane friday night with 20,000 people .
i 'm relieved and very humble .
de@@ tt@@ ori so@@ aks up the cheers as he brings in pre@@ dil@@ ection after victory
two jo@@ c@@ keys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jo@@ ckey richard johnson and retired 20@@ -@@ time champion sir anthony mc@@ co@@ y , who had more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recor@@ d@@ -@@ breaking career .
lester pig@@ got@@ t , nine@@ -@@ time derby winner , 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career wins
frankie is one of the best jo@@ c@@ keys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
i said to frankie a few weeks ago at ep@@ som he 'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn 't just a weekend and big@@ -@@ race jo@@ ckey !
seriously though , frankie 's been riding winners in the uk for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he 's a lively character which is good for british racing but more than that , he 's an incredible jo@@ ckey .
frankie de@@ tt@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dis@@ mount
from flying finishes to flying dis@@ moun@@ ts , frankie de@@ tt@@ ori has been the poster boy of british flat racing for two decades .
it has been a roll@@ er@@ coaster ride .
st@@ acks of big@@ -@@ race winners , including his famous 1996 ' magnificent seven ' at as@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six@@ -@@ month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to def@@ y the doub@@ ters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - de@@ tt@@ ori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
russia 's putin s@@ acks chief of staff sergei ivan@@ ov
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff sergei ivan@@ ov .
mr ivan@@ ov has been part of mr putin 's trusted inner circle for many years .
the 6@@ 3@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the kremlin said that mr putin had " decre@@ ed to relieve ivan@@ ov of his duties as head of the russian presidential administration , " but gave no reason .
mr ivan@@ ov 's deputy since 2012 , anton v@@ ain@@ o , has been appointed as his successor .
mr v@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the est@@ onian capital tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( m@@ gim@@ o ) and served in the tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the kremlin website says ( in russian ) .
on being appointed , he told mr putin : " thank you for your trust . "
i think the administration 's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
mr putin told a russian tv station on friday that mr ivan@@ ov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that mr v@@ ain@@ o should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has my@@ sti@@ fied moscow .
sergei ivan@@ ov has long been one of vladimir putin 's closest allies and , like him , served in the soviet security service , the k@@ gb .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with president putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall@@ -@@ out from some kind of power struggle ?
no@@ -@@ one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run russia 's environmental policy - has been met with great scep@@ ticism .
in remarks to mr putin , quoted on the kremlin website , mr ivan@@ ov said " it 's true that in early 2012 i asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that i 've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
mr ivan@@ ov took up the post in december 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and a former member of the k@@ gb state security service , like mr putin .
in the late 199@@ 0@@ s , when mr putin was head of the federal security service ( f@@ sb ) , which replaced the k@@ gb , mr ivan@@ ov was appointed as his deputy .
when mr putin came to power , he named mr ivan@@ ov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that mr ivan@@ ov might become president of russia after mr putin 's second term , as a third term for mr putin would have been un@@ constitutional .
but that post was taken by another close putin ally , dmit@@ ry medvedev .
mr putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years later .

queens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected to fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35@@ bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017
engineers have joined the queens@@ ferry crossing 's north deck and vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t - meaning the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closures between the " deck fans , " which are now ne@@ aring completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
the bridge section from fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 sta@@ y@@ -@@ cables .
the £ 1.@@ 35@@ bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017 .
economy secretary keith brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : " this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the queens@@ ferry crossing .
we 're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in ro@@ sy@@ th today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
michael martin , forth crossing bridge construc@@ tors project director said : " the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding north tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or land@@ ward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t 700 milli@@ metres south@@ wards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the toler@@ ances the team were working to were tiny - just a few milli@@ metres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
sim@@ one bil@@ es nails all@@ -@@ around gold in women 's gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
sim@@ one bil@@ es is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
effor@@ tless on beam .
ja@@ w@@ -@@ dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an olympic champion .
the 19@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old american gym@@ n@@ ast soared to the all@@ -@@ around title on thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the olympic spotlight .
her total of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was well clear of silver med@@ alist and " final five " team@@ mate aly rais@@ man and russian bronze med@@ alist ali@@ ya mu@@ staf@@ ina .
united states ' sim@@ one bil@@ es performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women 's individual all@@ -@@ around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday .
bil@@ es became the fourth straight american woman to win the all@@ -@@ around title and fifth overall while cem@@ enting her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ generation athletes like michael phel@@ ps who have taken their sports to new heights :
bil@@ es has spent the last three years domin@@ ating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 olympic champion mary lou re@@ tton called her " the greatest gym@@ n@@ ast i 've ever seen . "
one last test awaited in brazil , a contest not so much between bil@@ es and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family 's home in spring , texas , with a fist@@ ful of gol@@ ds would be seen as a disappointment .
united states ' sim@@ one bil@@ es , left , and aly rais@@ man embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women 's individual all@@ -@@ around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday , au@@ g .
bil@@ es earned the first one on tuesday while serving as the ex@@ clamation point to retiring national team coordinator martha kar@@ ol@@ yi 's going away party .
while bil@@ es insisted she 's never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that 's not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tum@@ bling pass - is set to latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the rio olympic arena .
it 's not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a todd@@ ler and discovered by coach ai@@ me@@ e bo@@ or@@ man 's mother during a field trip to the gym where bo@@ or@@ man was coaching has become a force .
she hasn 't lost an all@@ -@@ around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as bil@@ es wants it to .
though mu@@ staf@@ ina took a small lead through two ro@@ tations , it was a mi@@ rage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where bil@@ es is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on beam - and capped it with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on floor .
rais@@ man hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere form@@ ality - and tears appeared around bil@@ es ' glit@@ tery red , white and blue eyel@@ iner when the vision she once wrote in a sc@@ rap@@ book became a reality .
rais@@ man 's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to mu@@ staf@@ ina on a tie@@ breaker .
this time , the 22@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old team captain the americans call " grandma " was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for bil@@ es , the 19@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old 's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
ma@@ ha@@ j brown , 6 , " ri@@ ddled with bullets , " survi@@ ves philadelphia shooting
police say a 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old boy has been shot in philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old in the city this week .
the child 's grandparents identified him to cbs philadelphia as ma@@ ha@@ j brown .
the grandparents say brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his gro@@ in , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
" he just took a lot , his little body was ri@@ ddled with bullets , " his grandmother del@@ ores mel@@ ende@@ z tells the station .
i just can 't believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several sur@@ ger@@ ies .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
brown was among four people shot in the german@@ town section .
also shot were three men : two 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds and one 3@@ 2@@ -@@ year old .
one of the 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to cbs philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells cbs philadelphia it appears there was cross@@ fire between multiple gunmen .
assault weap@@ on@@ -@@ style shell cas@@ ings , traced to different assault style weapons , lit@@ tered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were cas@@ ings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed comb@@ at@@ ants out here and that they were actively engaged , " philadelphia police captain anthony gin@@ al@@ di told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet tuesday while playing in front of her home in the west oak lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need sim@@ one , gab@@ by and laurie
that 's what i call this year 's women 's olympic gymnastics team and for more reasons than one .
first , i have been to every summer olympics since 1984 and the usa has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gym@@ na@@ sts , sim@@ one bil@@ es , gab@@ by douglas and lauren " laurie " her@@ nan@@ dez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make@@ -@@ up of this team , rounded out by aly rais@@ man , who is jewish , and madison ko@@ ci@@ an , who is catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like america .
it also has solidified the black and lat@@ ina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gym@@ n@@ ast has been afric@@ an@@ -@@ american .
last year , sim@@ one and gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last olympics , gab@@ by douglas was a surprise olympic champion , and america cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three@@ -@@ time world champion sim@@ one bil@@ es , douglas and laurie her@@ nan@@ dez delivering the unexpected , yet master@@ ful gymnastics routines .
on thursday , sim@@ one became the fourth straight american to win gold in the women 's individual all@@ -@@ around event .
and team@@ mate aly rais@@ man earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
sim@@ one , gab@@ by and laurie all took the same path as aly and madison to make the olympic team .
they are the " final five " because the next olympic gymnastics team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts on the team , and this is mar@@ ta kar@@ ol@@ yi 's last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gym@@ na@@ sts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gym@@ na@@ sts get all of their training , and it 's a costly and long@@ -@@ term commitment for the gym@@ na@@ sts ' families .
ai@@ me@@ e bo@@ or@@ man , coach of sim@@ one bil@@ es , and maggie han@@ ey , coach of laurie her@@ nan@@ dez , have both co@@ ached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by sim@@ one , gab@@ by and laurie .
i founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low@@ -@@ cost gymnastics , based in har@@ lem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and his@@ panic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in september , we will be expanding to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life@@ -@@ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you sim@@ one , aly , laurie , gab@@ by and madison for that serious showcase of " girl power " in winning the olympic team gold and for motiv@@ ating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting jeremy hunt 's proposal
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in july , mr hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the n@@ hs was in " no man 's land " and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hours .
dr ellen mc@@ court , the b@@ ma 's junior doctors " committee chair , said in a statement last night : " junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . "
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the b@@ ma to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an un@@ willingness to engage and , at times , deaf@@ ening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from jeremy hunt just last month that his door is always open .
" jeremy hunt needs to act now , lift the im@@ position and address junior doctors " concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of april saw the post@@ pon@@ ement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the pic@@ ket line .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials .
the b@@ ma wants better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
daniel mor@@ timer , chief executive of n@@ hs employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
mr mor@@ timer said : " industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , care@@ rs and their families . "
over the last two months we have been talking with the junior doctors committee and have , along with the department of health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the guardian role and whist@@ le@@ blowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , health education england and the department of health were about hon@@ ouring the agreements reached with the b@@ ma in november , february and may .
the £ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti@@ -@@ clo@@ tting drug tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or sl@@ ashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
n@@ hs watch@@ dog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now n@@ hs watch@@ dog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people have a heart attack in england every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the buil@@ d@@ -@@ up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clo@@ t , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clo@@ t dis@@ lo@@ dges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , which is made by uk firm astra@@ zen@@ ec@@ a and sold under the trade name br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by making clo@@ ts less likely .
the draft nice guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 mg of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or for 12 months , followed by 60@@ mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
professor car@@ ole long@@ son , director at the nice health technology evaluation centre , said : " despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . "
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
the evidence shows that tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisi@@ on@@ ally recommending tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
pc culture let vote fraud in muslim areas flourish
ex@@ -@@ tower ham@@ lets mayor lu@@ t@@ fur ra@@ hman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex@@ -@@ cabinet minister sir eric pickles lam@@ ba@@ sts the police , election watch@@ dogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of " over@@ -@@ sensi@@ ti@@ vities about ethn@@ icity and religion . "
the former communities secretary , now the anti@@ -@@ corruption t@@ sar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cor@@ dons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take id to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting in@@ deli@@ ble ink on a person 's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whist@@ le@@ blow@@ ers , sir eric says .
he calls for the press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
" this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , " he said .
the report was ordered by dow@@ ning street in the wake of the tower ham@@ lets voting scandal in east london .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , lu@@ t@@ fur ra@@ hman , should be removed from office following a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found ra@@ hman " cyn@@ ically per@@ verted " the religious feeling of his muslim community and sil@@ enced his critics with accusations of racism and islam@@ opho@@ bia .
ra@@ hman , it was said , " ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful muslims to vote for him . "
up to 300 votes were du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of person@@ ation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
sir eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
sir eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your id to prove who you are
his report says : " evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of pakistani and banglad@@ eshi background .
" there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of " politically correct " over@@ -@@ sensi@@ ti@@ vities about ethn@@ icity and religion . "
sir eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop " vote harvesting . "
the report , being considered by the@@ resa may , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce id before voting .
use in@@ deli@@ ble ink on a person 's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three@@ -@@ year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaig@@ ners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cor@@ dons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the representation of the people act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only english is to be used in polling stations ( except in wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
sir eric sav@@ ages the metropolitan police , saying it is " astonishing " that no criminal charges were brought after the tower ham@@ lets case .
" the election court dis@@ qualified lu@@ t@@ fur ra@@ hman and his agent for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , " he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effec@@ tual " tic@@ k@@ -@@ box inspections " of town hall electoral registration departments .
sir eric said : " last year 's court ruling in tower ham@@ lets was a wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for kate 's cycl@@ ist look@@ alike and other cele@@ b dop@@ pel@@ gang@@ ers of rio olym@@ pi@@ ans
fans of the rio 2016 olympics this week have gone wild for french cycl@@ ist paul@@ ine ferr@@ and@@ -@@ pre@@ vo@@ t , who has proven an impressive look@@ alike for the duchess of cambridge .
but the 24@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old olym@@ pian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity dop@@ pel@@ g@@ anger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the rio games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , fe@@ mail have compiled a list of olym@@ pi@@ ans who bear more than a passing resem@@ blance with hollywood cele@@ bs .
the hunter and the wolf : u.s. men 's arch@@ ery team member bra@@ dy el@@ lis@@ on , left , has been compared to leonardo dic@@ ap@@ rio since he was a kid
aside from kate 's dop@@ pel@@ g@@ anger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of a@@ -@@ lis@@ ter leonardo dic@@ ap@@ rio .
u.s. men 's arch@@ ery team member bra@@ dy el@@ lis@@ on has caused a storm on twitter after images of him looking e@@ er@@ ily similar to the wolf of wall street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like leo since he was a kid .
'@@ i personally don 't see a huge resem@@ blance , maybe besides the facial hair , ' bra@@ dy told hu@@ ff@@ ington post .
'@@ he is a good@@ -@@ looking dude so i guess it 's a compliment . '
one of the most popular comparisons from london 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking lik@@ eness between british long jumper greg ru@@ ther@@ ford and popular actor neil patrick harris .
russian gym@@ n@@ ast ali@@ ya mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead r@@ inger for cu@@ ban@@ -@@ american singer gloria este@@ fan .
and over in the pool , south african swimmer cameron van der burgh has been getting compared to glee star matthew mor@@ rison for years now .
changing it up : this user reck@@ ons that nathan is an ' athletic version ' of the inception actor
another long@@ -@@ running comparison has been between tennis star ra@@ fa@@ el nad@@ al and actor josh hart@@ nett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips .
silver medal swimmer russia 's yu@@ lia e@@ fi@@ mo@@ va boasts more than just the same sun@@ kissed skin and blonde hair as actress ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne mc@@ cord , while team usa 's nathan adrian has been said by fans to resemble an ' athletic version of joseph g@@ org@@ on le@@ vit@@ t . ' 
tough women : soccer star hope solo , left , and dexter actress jennifer carpenter , right , have similar face shapes and eyes
not the only one : one twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the simil@@ ari@@ tiest
floating a theory : according to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pair 's similar looks
one twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that ' the rest of the internet thinks that hope solo and jennifer carpenter are actually identical . ' 
indeed , the usa soccer star and the dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes .
other popular comparisons have included ker@@ ri wal@@ sh@@ -@@ jen@@ nings and her smile that is near@@ -@@ identical to that of actress laura lin@@ ney , as well as gold med@@ al@@ -@@ winning gym@@ n@@ ast gab@@ by douglas , who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of bring it on star gabri@@ elle union .

pri@@ mark shop@@ per outra@@ ged at woman who braz@@ en@@ ly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn 't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on kn@@ ickers on the shop floor in the middle of a pri@@ mark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in bou@@ ver@@ ie place shopping centre , fol@@ ke@@ stone .
the pri@@ mark store in bou@@ ver@@ ie place shopping centre , fol@@ ke@@ stone , where the woman tried on kn@@ ickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ two , jenny davi@@ dson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman ' got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything . ' 
she said : ' people couldn 't believe what they were seeing . ' 
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of kn@@ ickers from the display , stripped off her own ti@@ ghts and pants and put them on .
'@@ she didn 't try to find anywhere discre@@ et to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass . '
'@@ everyone was staring as she took the kn@@ ickers off again and obviously didn 't like them because she put them back on the shelf . '
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
'@@ she didn 't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the kn@@ ickers she 'd been trying on . '
ms davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in the kent town , said : ' how disgusting to think someone is going to take home kn@@ ickers that another person has been wearing and they haven 't been cleaned . ' 
the incident happened on tuesday afternoon .
ms davi@@ dson added : ' i gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well . ' 
'@@ i 'd hate to get home with a new pair of kn@@ ickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn 't been washed . '
a pri@@ mark spokesman said : ' pri@@ mark is aware of an incident which took place in our fol@@ ke@@ stone store on tuesday august 9 . ' 
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using kra@@ v mag@@ a
it 's a dangerous world out there , but this video from da@@ ily@@ mail@@ .@@ com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to r@@ hon miz@@ ra@@ chi , new yor@@ k@@ -@@ based grand@@ master of the kra@@ v mag@@ a federation , to find out how to deal with gun@@ -@@ to@@ ting mu@@ ggers at close range .
whether you 're approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mu@@ gger .
if approached from behind , miz@@ ra@@ chi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and ' clear the line of fire ' .
you then grasp the gun between your fore@@ arm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the gro@@ in follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , sm@@ ack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it 's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can 't fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how miz@@ ra@@ chi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mu@@ gging - if you 're not a kra@@ v mag@@ a grand@@ master - is to hand over your cash .
family of y@@ ob@@ s destroyed sal@@ t@@ ash , corn@@ wall council house ahead of ev@@ iction
a family of y@@ ob@@ s left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were ev@@ ic@@ ted for terror@@ ising their neighbours .
t@@ anya sk@@ el@@ don and her partner sh@@ au@@ n tre@@ bil@@ cock have been kicked out of the property in sal@@ t@@ ash , corn@@ wall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of dis@@ repair .
the walls were left with g@@ aping holes , flo@@ or@@ boards were ripped up , rubbish was stre@@ wn over the floor and graffiti was dau@@ bed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accom@@ od@@ ation
donna mc@@ evo@@ y , housing manager at corn@@ wall housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : ' it 's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and i don 't think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ nice element of corn@@ wall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermit@@ tently and police say the reign of terror the family inflic@@ ted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intim@@ id@@ ating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the ten@@ ancy , was given an anti@@ social behaviour order in june .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
corn@@ wall housing ev@@ ic@@ ted her and her partner force@@ fully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the ev@@ iction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : ' they didn 't care about anybody . ' 
we lived next to them for 20 years and it 's always been bad .
the amount of times we 've seen the police down here is unbelievable .
'@@ this morning , we couldn 't sleep . '
we got up because it was so quiet here - we 're not used to that !
it 's going to be lovely now that they 're finally gone .
adam fitz@@ patrick , corn@@ wall housing 's neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the over@@ grown side of the council house
he added : ' it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as ev@@ iction is always the last course of action that corn@@ wall housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
i appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , dev@@ on and corn@@ wall police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
i hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that anti@@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
mr fitz@@ patrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20@@ s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the ev@@ iction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police ra@@ ided the property and found more than 70@@ g in can@@ nab@@ is as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and £ 1,@@ 700 in cash .
sk@@ el@@ don was fined after ple@@ ading guilty to possession of a class b drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a head@@ stone for her son , lee sk@@ el@@ don , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that t@@ anya and her partner are now living in private housing in pl@@ ym@@ outh .
the walls of many of the house 's rooms had graffiti scra@@ w@@ led across them .
police say they will seek to ev@@ ict tenants who fl@@ out the rules of their ten@@ ancies
angela crow , of dev@@ on and corn@@ wall police , said the ev@@ iction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to fl@@ out the rules .
'@@ this sends out to those who feel that they can behave without rec@@ ri@@ mination , as well as those b@@ lighted by such behaviour , ' she said .
criminal and anti@@ social behaviour will never be tolerated by dev@@ on and corn@@ wall police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
reid says clinton will stick with gar@@ land as supreme court nominee if elected
senate democratic leader harry reid says he is convinced that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will nom@@ inate judge mer@@ rick gar@@ land to the supreme court if she is elected president .
senate republicans have blocked gar@@ land 's confirmation since president barack obama nominated him in march .
senate majority leader mitch mc@@ conn@@ ell says the next president will choose the person to replace late supreme court justice anton@@ in sc@@ alia .
reid said on a conference call thursday that he is predicting clinton will pick gar@@ land " with some degree of credibility . "
a spokeswoman for reid later said he had not spoken to clinton directly about whether she would nom@@ inate gar@@ land and was specul@@ ating .
he praised gar@@ land and said clinton 's team would not want to " rock the boat " with a new pick .
gar@@ land is the chief judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit .
reid said republicans who are blocking gar@@ land 's nomination are " mini@@ ons " and " enab@@ lers " of republican presidential candidate donald trump .

french court rejec@@ ts bid to demol@@ ish shops at jungle refugee camp
a french court has rejected a bid by cal@@ ais authorities to demol@@ ish dozens of makes@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , cal@@ ais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makes@@ hi@@ ft shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hair@@ cuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40@@ p ) or basic meals for a few euros in makes@@ hi@@ ft restaurants .
the cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ect 's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state@@ -@@ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makes@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a lil@@ le court ruled there was no legal basis for exp@@ elling the people running the 72 makes@@ hi@@ ft shops , but said the cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ect 's concerns " were totally understandable . "
the judge , je@@ an@@ -@@ fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is mol@@ la , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that " live in extremely pre@@ car@@ ious conditions . "
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp 's jungle book kids " cafe which is run not@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ profit and provides 200 meals a day , english and french classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied minors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids " cafe .
a letter sent to the guardian said its closure " would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . "
two charities , help refugees and l '@@ au@@ ber@@ ge des migrants , on friday estimated that numbers in the jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arri@@ vals during the summer .
" this 5,@@ 000@@ -@@ yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money . "
zhou fen , a girl who was registered in the pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken file of mi@@ po village , changle town , huayuan county , received the letter of admission from university of south china .
when she was worried about the tuition , the county committee of the communist youth league offered she a 5@@ 000@@ -@@ yuan subsidy on august 9 .
recently , the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled 2.@@ 8@@ 38 million yuan to over 6@@ 90 pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken college students .
it also organized social fun@@ d@@ -@@ raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accomplish their study .
this year , huayuan county integrated more than rmb 18.@@ 5 million of educational funds and self@@ -@@ raised more than rmb 2.5 million , which will be injected into the real@@ -@@ name bank accounts of the corresponding students .
" i thought my elder brother and i cannot afford the college study after my father passed away . it never occurred to me before the county government helped us so timely . " she said gra@@ te@@ fully .
as of august 8 , huayuan county had raised more than 21 million yuan of various relief funds this first half year for 13,@@ 140 pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken students .
all pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken students of the county that should be supported have been supported financially .
according to the reporter on the scene , a large container truck shifted to the fast lane with the command of a traffic policeman . its container box fell down onto the green road , making a 2 cm deep pit on the road .
according to the xinhua news agency , australia 's new south wales government announced on the 11@@ th day of the month that it will spend 200 million australian dollars ( about 15@@ 4 million us dollars ) to launch the biggest renovation on the famous sydney opera house since its establishment .
the new south wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house .
the sydney opera house is one of sydney 's landmark buildings , designed by danish architect jor@@ n ut@@ z@@ on and built in 1973 . it welcomes about 8 million visitors each year .
r@@ ory jeff@@ es , general manager of the sydney symphony orchestra , believes that the sydney opera house will make a " turn@@ around " via this renovation and become one of the world 's concerts with the best sound effects .
non@@ -@@ permanent residents who have lived in beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous schooling in beijing can apply for a residence permit .
recently , the launch of implementation details of " residence permit provisional regulations " indicates that the " temporary residence permit " will be upgraded to " residence permit " .
a responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the " temporary residence permit " to " residence permit " means that beijing will shift its administration for non@@ -@@ permanent residents from the " management " to multi@@ -@@ directional services .
today , a reporter learned from the state administration of taxation ( sat ) that as of the end of june this year , the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 70 illegal " blacklist " cases .
it is understood that in july 2014 , sat took the first step in the central government departments to issue an information disclosure methods for major tax violations along with the tax credit management approach .
in addition to the illegal facts , legal basis , the handling and punishment of these cases , the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant intermediaries will be included in the " blacklist " exposure .
quality inspection , treasury , customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary measures against the " blacklist " parties .
" the credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society , which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature . "
" environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere , water and soil pollution , but the root still lies in the mode of production and living . "
for example , the land development ratio of jiangsu province was up to 21 % in 2015 , ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of china .
therefore , the problem of high pollution , heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles .
on the one hand , jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes . but on the other hand , the resource and environment pressure is heavy .
to sol@@ idly promote the ecological environment protection and governance , we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people 's livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction .
on the 11@@ th day of the month , 42 wind turbine blades produced by guo@@ dian group was prepared to be shipped and exported to south africa from the wharf of lianyungang port .
since last year , guo@@ dian group has exported a total of 16@@ 3 sets of wind power projects from lianyungang port to south africa .
the third party company ( non@@ -@@ chinese company ) commissioned by the olympic organizing committee is located in the sao paulo state , brazil , about 75 kilometers away from the city of sao paulo .
to urge the manufacturers to finish the production as@@ ap , the chinese consulate general in sao paulo sent speci@@ ally@@ -@@ assigned persons to the manufacturer for in@@ -@@ depth work .
after overtime work of 30 hours , the manufacturer finally completed the chinese flag production and loaded for transportation . the task was finished 4@@ -@@ 5 working days in advance .
it is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in rio on the 11@@ th . then the olympic organizing committee will send the flags to various olympic venues after receiving the flag . the whole process will be under the supervision of the chinese embassy in brazil .
( this newspaper ) on the 10@@ th day of the month , the nantong municipal government held a series of cooperation activities at the shanghai international convention center . more than 180 shanghai enterprises were invited to participate . more than 20 hu@@ -@@ tong industry docking projects worth at least rmb 100 million saw on@@ -@@ site signing .
the 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of rmb 8.@@ 0@@ 63 billion , involving new energy , new materials , modern services and other industries .
qingdao is china 's 12@@ th and also shandong 's first trial city to use and trade emissions .
on the 11@@ th day of the month , many companies came to the qingdao municipal emissions trading center to submit emissions subscription . after acceptance , they shall pay fees .
the upcoming first single transaction also indicates that qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off . it will also be the first emissions trading in shandong and the first city@@ -@@ level emissions trading in china .
in the morning of 11@@ th day of the month , zhao xiu@@ ping , the general manager of qingdao shuang@@ tao fine chemical ( group ) co . , lt@@ d. came to the trading center to submit emissions subscription .
its plant in the old urban area of qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in ping@@ du due to environmental reason .
after zhao xiu@@ ping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report , etc . , qingdao municipal emissions reserve and trading service center began to review the application materials .
according to the collection standard determined by qingdao price bureau and financial sector , the estimated initial emission fee is about 6@@ 4@@ 1,200 yuan . the working staff will finish review within 7 working days .
the upcoming first single transaction also indicates that qingdao emissions trading pilot will officially kick off . it will also be the first emissions trading in shandong and the first city@@ -@@ level emissions trading in china .
according to zhao xiu@@ ping , up to rmb 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection . such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management .
on the same day , qingdao s@@ f@@ -@@ x@@ c@@ -@@ zz coach component co . , lt@@ d. also came to purchase emission rights for its project with an annual output of 4,@@ 200 interior accessories of high@@ -@@ speed rail and cr@@ h .
the project is a mechanical processing enterprise . its initial emission rate for the chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) and ammonia ( nox ) are 0.@@ 5@@ 14 tons / year and 0.0@@ 52 tons / year , respectively .
the paid use and trading of air pollutant emission permits cover the city 's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat .
on january 1 , 2016 , the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use .
the obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge , so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will .
han hongyan , deputy director of qingdao environmental protection bureau , introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations . illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circum@@ vent punishment via purchasing emission rights .
in other words , we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises ' over standard discharge behaviors , so as to protect the environment and public health .
now for their own interests , enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control , cherished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants .
with the economic interests drive , to reduce pollutants ' discharge has shifted from the government 's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior , so as to truly protect the environment , nature and public health .
emission right , also known as " dumping right " , means the right to discharge pollutants . it refers to the right for em@@ itters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government .
this right is essentially the right of the em@@ itters to occupy , use and benefit from environmental capacity resources .
next , under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume , the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange .
since the proposition of emissions trading by american economist dy@@ ers in 1968 , it has been applied by the united states of america to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 197@@ 0@@ s .
since its pilot in china in 2007 , it has been applied to 14 provinces ( autonomous regions and municipalities ) including zhejiang and jiangsu .
according to the ministry of defense of russia , in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the " islamic state " target in syria , a number of russian fighters lifted from the syrian mah@@ mir air force base to provide support .
on february 22 this year , the united states and russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the syrian conflict . the ceasefire agreement will be implemented since february 27 .
under the agreement , the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including " islamic state " and " salvation front " , which were identified by the united nation security council .
russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the russian soldiers will be protected correspon@@ dingly .
he also said that if the extremist forces were not hit , these forces will be extended to russia .
although russia and the west did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of syria , russia would strengthen cooperation with syria , iran and iraq in this regard .
in september 2015 , russia , at the invitation of the syrian government , began a military strike against syrian extremist forces .
on march 15 this year , russia 's major military forces began to evacuate , but the russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in he@@ imi mim@@ i and the naval base in tar@@ tus .

there is no fixed pattern of rural development , but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes . one of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages .
shanghai songjiang district traffic control department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driving . as a result , more than 30 cases were detected in a week .
with the popularity of smart phones , mobile phones become more and more funny . wechat , microblogging and even games , shopping on taobao have become normal . it seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment , and cannot stop even when driving .
according to " road traffic safety act " , mobile phones playing are banned and defined as " behavior preventing safe driving " .
unfortunately , due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evi@@ dences , those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of decoration .
if the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normal@@ ize such measures , such illegal behaviors will surely be cur@@ bed .

xiamen girl zhang bin@@ bin : " handsome hands " encourage her to start shooting career , which saw several " reverse "
zhang don@@ ghong , a villager of the east park village , xiamen xiang 'an district , changed his 29@@ -@@ inch old tv into a 65@@ -@@ inch tv just a few days before .
the ordinary farmer has a daughter , named zhang bin@@ bin . she is the one to win san@@ zi final silver medal of olympic games women 's 50@@ -@@ meters rifle games for china in the evening of the eleventh .
in the evening of the 11@@ th day of the month , just in front of this new tv set , the zhang don@@ ghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple 's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the prelimin@@ aries to almost winning .
at the game , zhang bin@@ bin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final .
but her parents and friends did not give up , kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game . zhang bin@@ bin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final . at this time , a burst of cheers broke out in her home .
in the final , zhang bin@@ bin also started from lagging behind and shot more st@@ ably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion .
this year , the 27@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old zhang bin@@ bin , in the 16@@ -@@ year shooting career , has actually missed the silver medal for several times .
according to her mother zhang xiaolong , her daughter sent a few " little persu@@ aders " from her village at their hesitation .
these little persu@@ aders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time , including zhang bin@@ bin 's cousin .
just after coming to xiamen team , zhang bin@@ bin once again took the initiative to return to xiang 'an school because of her family difficulties .
but after the repeated efforts of her enligh@@ tening teacher , zhang bin@@ bin returned to xiamen team .
and after she came into the provincial team , zhang bin@@ bin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time .
this time , not only the coach zhang ya@@ jie , but also the leaders and coach of xiamen shooting arch@@ ery sports center and fujian provincial team came to her home . with their efforts , zhang bin@@ bin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team .
just at yesterday 's game , the xiamen girl achieved several revers@@ als of the shooting with her insistence .
" each coach has his own method to choose the potential player . i decided to take her once i saw her beautiful hands . "
zhang don@@ ghong also recalled , in the training test , although the results of her daughter were not the best , her rings were very stable , which is also an important reason for zhang bin@@ bin to attract coaches .
during the training process of zhang bin@@ bin , it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed zhang ya@@ jie most .
he recalled that after zhang bin@@ bin came into the xiamen shooting team more than a year later , the team carried out a long shot of gun training , requiring players not to move for half an hour .
zhang xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well@@ -@@ behaved child , with the hobby of painting and producing toys .
" i used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs . bin@@ bin picked up some scra@@ ps to make her own dolls . "
she said , her daughter often se@@ wed hand toys . plus , she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll 's facial features to clothing .
as an athlete , zhang bin@@ bin and her family are separate more than being together . as she can only return home during festi@@ vities , she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time .
according to her parents , no matter meeting in person or talking by phone , zhang bin@@ bin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things .
because they cannot often see their daughter , they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years .
zhang xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter , " she should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter . "
in the living room on the second floor of zhang bin@@ bin , there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates .
zhang don@@ ghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage . " this is honor made by bin@@ bin after a dozen of years ' efforts . we feel quite cherished . "

china 's mars program is coming
china mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding , landing and patrolling at one time , which has never occurred in foreign countries .
china 's mars exploration launch target is to step around , land and patrol at one time . such task has considerable difficulty .
because the mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months , experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first mars probe in 2020 .
according to xu da@@ zhe , although china 's aircraft has entered a deep space , it is still essential to finish the task of mars exploration . the detection of mars means that china has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense .
" every two or three years , there is a chance that mars is closest to earth . and at this point , it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle . "
" taking into account the mass of mars detectors , it will be the job of china 's long march 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission . "
china 's mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding , landing and patrolling at one time , which has never occurred in foreign countries . there was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries , but the landing failed .
mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas . in particular , although the rover is a space detector , it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector .
in other words , the mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles .
according to pang zhi@@ hao , a researcher of the fifth institute of china 's aerospace science and technology group , the reason for human being to favor mars exploration is because mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings .
currently , the mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research . the history of human beings to use space detectors for mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration .
therefore , the human beings hope that one day on the mars to establish a base of residence , and ultimately to mars immigration , it turned into a second home of mankind .
a large number of signs also show that the mars is likely to be the same as the current earth , only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin , low temperature , water deple@@ tion and so on .
therefore , the detection or manned landing on the mars for research can help propose a pre@@ -@@ arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second mars which is difficult for human beings to in@@ habit .
as of june 2016 , the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explor@@ ations , including 43 mars detection missions .
however , ever since the 199@@ 0@@ s , a total of 18 human explor@@ ations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detec@@ tions have been conducted .
there are currently five mars or@@ bit@@ ers and two mars ro@@ vers at work , but only one lunar or@@ bi@@ ter and one lunar lander are at work .
world space powers have developed a detection plan with the mars system as target . so we can see the current mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection .
on nov@@ . 5 , 2013 , india launched the first mars probe " mang@@ alian " , and has become asia 's first country for successful detection of the mars .
" mang@@ alian " is used to study the surface , the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the mars .
the hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceler@@ ation .
according to sun ze@@ zhou , the chief designer of a mars detector of the china aerospace science and technology corporation , the mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges .
the atmospheric pressure of the mars is very low , only 1 % of the earth 's surface atmospheric pressure , with high uncertainty .
scientists have not had a thorough understanding of mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics .
a dust storm similar to the earth 's dust is often formed in the mars in the summer , which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy . so a " sleep " mode must be designed for the mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms .
at the same time , the martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight , which poses a problem for the energy supply for mars detection .
this requires that the detector 's sun wing area to be larger , and need to constantly adjust , and strive to align with the sun direction .
in addition , since the gravity of the mars is only 38 % of that of the earth and much higher than that of the moon surface , so the probe requires higher power .
" the core and the most difficult part of the mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceler@@ ation process after the probe enters martian atmosphere . there is just one chance to ensure success . "
according to sun ze , it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the earth and the mars is quite large .
because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed , the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the mars while landing the mars . however , it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the mars on earth .
pang zhi@@ hao said , in general , the way to detect the mars is similar to the way to detect the moon . the entire process is also " surrounding , landing , patrolling and returning " to achieve the goal of manned landing on the mars .
because the distance between the mars and the earth is larger than that between the moon and earth , it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the mars detection .
according to taiwanese media reports , lin quan , the head of taiwan 's executive yuan , announced yesterday morning , " ill@@ -@@ gotten party assets handling regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations " will take effective since today .
kmt vice chairman zhan qi@@ xian said , " kuomintang , with a hundred years of history , will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility . "
lin quan stressed that if the political party , accompanying organization or trus@@ tees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban , the commission will investigate and punish " according to the law " .
lin quan also announced that hong pe@@ ig@@ en , " deputy director of the independent " , will serve as the vice chairman of the ill@@ -@@ gotten party assets settlement committee .
he said that gu li@@ xiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the ill@@ -@@ gotten party assets handling regulations . the experience of hong pe@@ ig@@ en who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related ill@@ -@@ gotten party assets .
zhan qi@@ xian said that , as long as there are party assets today , no one will give you social donations . so if the party were all confiscated away , then kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship , " you will have chance to go when there are no assets . "
zhan qi@@ xian also stressed that even if the ill@@ -@@ gotten party assets handling regulations goes into effect and the kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated , the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised , the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch .
original title : suit launched by " corridor doctor " lan yu@@ efeng against cctv host wang zhi 'an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment
the legal evening news : because the cctv host wang zhi 'an published his remarks against the " corridor doctor " event on microblogging , lan yu@@ efeng brought wang zhi 'an and beijing micro dream chuang@@ ke network technology co . , lt@@ d. to the court .
yesterday afternoon , haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that wang zhi 'an and micro dream company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the lan yu@@ efeng for all the claims .
at the beginning of 2014 , cctv reporter wang zhi 'an found after his survey that although lan yu@@ efeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media , these reports had a lot of false information .
on march 29 , 2014 , the " corridor doctor " program produced by cctv news survey broadcasted .
all information about the so@@ -@@ called over@@ -@@ medical treatment reported by lan yu@@ efeng to the media do not have any evidence support .
in the microblogging with real@@ -@@ name certification , wang zhi 'an also said that the reason for lan yu@@ efeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality " .
lan yu@@ efeng claimed that wang zhi 'an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage sol@@ ati@@ um .
at the time of the trial , the two sides argued whether wang zhi@@ an violated the reputation right of lan yu@@ efeng .
highlight of the 12@@ th day of the month : at the beginning of track and field events , the chinese team is quite busy and the women 's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games
the bicycle game is expected to realize the " zero breakthrough " in the olympic gold medal while the women 's world cup girls will challenge germany team , the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four .
wang zhen was quite outstanding in the two races . he won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this may .
according to foreign media reports , zhang hu@@ izhen , the 27@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old korean arch@@ ery female player won the gold medal in the women 's arch@@ ery individual tournament . this is the second scoring of olympic gold medal following the team competition . this made she become a double winner .
zhang hu@@ izhen is considered as a late bloom@@ er . she regrets about not winning the last session of the london olympic games tickets before , but now she proudly stands on the top of the rio olympic podium .
zhang hu@@ izhen won the gold medal in lisa weng@@ lu , a total score of 6@@ -@@ 2 in the women 's arch@@ ery finals at the sam@@ ba boulevard in rio de janeiro , brazil .
she did arch@@ ery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school . she won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014 . so she is a late bloom@@ er .
zhang hu@@ izhen recalled , " my performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition .

although not yet confirmed , it is said by many sources that apple 's 2016 autumn conference will be held in september , and i@@ phone@@ 7 would really be launched into the market .
although apple did not respond , there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iphone . there are even the images of i@@ phone@@ 7 " real machine model " on the internet .
the new generation of iphone is really " eye@@ -@@ catching " , hot and hard@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ get . if you want to buy the genuine product at the first time , you must choose a good channel , for example , suning .
this has exacerbated people 's disappointment of the new iphone , " it is length@@ ened , but cannot be used to cast holographic images ! this generation of iphone is so terrible . "
i@@ phone@@ 7 , just like other iphones , brings countless secret before birth .
in addition , there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iphone will have the 3.@@ 5@@ mm head@@ phone jack cancelled , and adopt bluetooth connection and charging interface instead , which will provide space for apple to add a second speaker .
another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014 , apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface .
another evidence to confirm this message is that apple allows the head@@ phone manufacturer to produce head@@ phone via the connection of charge interface .
whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 apple autumn conference .
but this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of i@@ phone@@ 7 - many people think that i@@ phone@@ 7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of apple 's iphone series , although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution idc that the market share of iphone will decline to some degree .
among them , goldman sachs ranked apple 's stock to be the rating of " buying " while b@@ mo analyst thought that i@@ phone@@ 7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement .
meanwhile , broad@@ com ceo ho@@ ck tan also said that apple 's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20 % , which is entirely due to the introduction of i@@ phone@@ 7 .
7 % of respondents said they have the plan to buy i@@ phone@@ 7 , while only 4 % people had the plan to buy i@@ phone@@ 6 .
it is understood that currently 20 % of user groups of i@@ phone@@ 6 or 6@@ plus have such a plan to purchase i@@ phone@@ 7 . this is a quite high proportion .
secondly , according to expert analysis , most of the iphone fans like to replace their own iphone mobile phone .
according to statistics , among all iphone users , about 26 % of users have not changed their phones for 2 years . that is , almost 120 million users of iphones have been using the same iphone for 2 years .
according to media , taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of i@@ phone@@ 7 . " the destruction of t@@ sm@@ c production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of i@@ phone@@ 7 . "
supply and demand contradiction will affect the average user , so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine i@@ phone@@ 7 for the first time .
according to informed sources , recently , suning executives and apple frequently meet , with the purpose to prepare adequate supply .
operators have negotiated with suning . so it is foreseeable that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides , lower prices and more intimate services will inevitably bring to users .
" with the lowest price , the consumer may " buy i@@ phone@@ 7 with just 7 yuan per day " .
adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of i@@ phone@@ 7 buying . suning 's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience .
maybe you 'll get a call at midnight . " hello , suning tesco , your i@@ phone@@ 7 is here . "

according to foreign media reports , the " green pool " incident of rio olympic games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green .
however , on the morning of the 10@@ th day of the month , the water of the match pool adjacent to the water pool also turned green .
australian water polo conte@@ stant said that his eyes feel ting@@ ling and would like to shed tears .

" we have been following the normal procedure these days , but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality . "

on the morning of august 12 , the state council information office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in july 2016 .
sheng yun@@ yun , spokesman of national bureau of statistics and head of national economic statistics division said that , in july , the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range .
according to the data of national bureau of statistics , the fixed asset investment growth , total imports and other data in july have come down .
sheng lai@@ yun said , as for the national economy in july , i would like to use the words of premier , " the shape is volatile and the potential is still good " . this is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in july .
he explained that " the shape of the fluctuations " refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in july .
in july , the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment , the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected , so the export pressure is still relatively heavy .
as for the domestic situation , the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment , adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure , so some indicators are still fluctu@@ ating .
sheng lai@@ yun pointed out that there was a special case in july , with serious floods , high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas .
according to the recent report of the ministry of civil affairs , more than 60 million people were affected , with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan .
from the view of industrial , investment and transpor@@ t@@ -@@ related indicators , these areas are affected to varying degrees .
the cargo turnover growth rate in july fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic .
from these factors , it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators . and such thing is expected .
he said , " the potential is still good " means that despite the fall@@ back of economic growth , the overall economic performance is stable and steady . and the good momentum has not changed .
in july , cpi rose by 1.8 % , with a mon@@ th@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ month rise of 0.2 % . from january to july , cpi rose by 2.1 % , so the overall price situation is stable .
according to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the chongqing municipal bureau of meteorology , in addition to you@@ yang , the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance .
at present , at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance , but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same , and people in chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high@@ -@@ temperature working days .
in case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃ , people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day . in case of temperature above 37 ℃ , people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan .
in case of temperature above 40 ℃ , staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance ( but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance ) .
in accordance with this standard , people in ka@@ izhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan . and people in cheng@@ kou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan . and the maximum temperature of you@@ yang did not meet the high temperature standards , so there is no high temperature allowance .
in the past , many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance . the city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation .
employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of termin@@ ating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather .
the city 's human resources and social security bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature , they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12@@ 3@@ 33 for complaint .
if the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance , the labore@@ r may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above .
at the same time , because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare , such allowance shall be included in the total wages , with tax deducted .
so the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage , it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks .

grac@@ ia is a cute female tou@@ can , exu@@ ding the breath of tropical rain forest .
in costa rica , one of the central american countries , tou@@ can grac@@ ia and its story have long been known .
at the press conference on august 10 , after postoperative rehabilitation , gre@@ sham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3@@ d printing plastic be@@ ak .

the newcomer gre@@ cia was slightly shy initially , but soon became lively , rolling in the basin fro@@ lic and eating grapes with a new be@@ ak .
in order to remind people that it has suffered damage , the technical staff did not give it a new be@@ ak color , but to retain the original white color of the 3@@ d print material .
the be@@ ak is a thin layer of hor@@ ny sheath , which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support .
despite this internal reinforcement , the tou@@ can 's be@@ ak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt .
animal rescue center , or@@ ni@@ th@@ ologist and a us 3@@ d printing company worked together to prepare several " test be@@ ak " for grac@@ ia and finally built a " perfect be@@ ak " for it .
now grac@@ ia has been able to use the new be@@ ak to drink water , eat , and even pec@@ k fine grains .
" the design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4@@ -@@ 5 hours to print it . "
" 3@@ d printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life . " thomas l@@ ange , the chairman of us s@@ g@@ 3@@ d printing company said in an interview with xinhua international .
in january 2015 , grac@@ ia , lying on a farm in the town of al@@ a@@ ju@@ ela in the middle of costa rica , was found with blood covering on its body .
at that time , its be@@ ak was cru@@ elly broken by a group of young people . it was completely unable to eat and dying .
after the tragedy of the grac@@ ia was reported by the media , there are a tide of animal anti@@ -@@ abuse call occurring inside and outside costa rica .
people demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against ab@@ users .
people came spontaneously to try their utmost to help grac@@ ia restore its life before hurting .
even the inventor of the 3@@ d printing technology , chuck hull , is also involved in the design of the grac@@ ia be@@ ak .
" the situation of grac@@ ia is very special , and its remaining part of the be@@ ak is less than 1 centi@@ meter , so there are many difficulties in installing the new be@@ ak . "
" we first scanned grac@@ ia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its be@@ ak and fixed on its be@@ ak with glue . "
" this can reduce the risk of further intr@@ usive damage to grac@@ ia , " l@@ ange told xinhua international .
before installing the prosthesis , the staff cleared the broken be@@ ak of grac@@ ia every day to prevent infection .
thousands of miles away , the story of the tou@@ can grac@@ ia touched the famous documentary director paula el re@@ idi@@ a and the news channel producer john ho@@ ffman .
they recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new be@@ ak , and recorded a documentary " the country of tou@@ can " , which was played this month on the animal planet channel .
the documentary " the state of the tou@@ can " shows people how a small tou@@ can has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals .
core tip : japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of chinese oil companies , especially known as the " teapot " of china 's small independent refinery .
august 12 report on can@@ kao@@ xiao@@ xi website : japan 's largest oil company j@@ x energy believes that " china 's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn . "
japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of chinese oil companies , especially known as the " teapot " of china 's small independent refinery .
china 's oil products are gradually close to japan 's oil products because the chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations .
before obtaining the import license for crude oil , " teapot refinery " generally refin@@ es oil from the heavy oil , which has high sulfur content and is imported from russia .
the petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution .

east fuel general oil company said , " with china 's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve , the refining capacity of the equipment also increased .
as a result , the quality of oil products exported from china gradually ri@@ v@@ alled that of japan ( the world 's highest quality ) .
according to j@@ x energy , " after the end of 2015 , china began to export high@@ -@@ quality light oil to australia . " such light oil products are competitive with japanese products on the asian market .
although the " japanese high quality oil " falls into a crisis , the japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of " exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market " .
as china 's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the asian market , teapot refinery got more atten@@ tions .

during some nights , the ion@@ ized layer is full of free electrons , which means that the radio signal can go further .
according to the report of popular science , an american monthly website , on august 11 , the us air force was interested in copying this effect .
although the stable ion@@ izing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station , but this may not be the interest of the us air force .
ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts . in addition , it may prevent the global positioning system ( gps ) signal from the solar storm .
the final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement . they may enhance ionization layer when necessary .
but firstly , the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work .
industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons .
over the past decade , the state council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity .
although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry , the target industry is directly related with coal industry .
from last november to this january , the price of qinhuangdao 5@@ 500 k@@ cal steam coal ling@@ ers at 370 yuan / ton and 90 % of the coal enterprises fell into a loss .
and since february , coal prices gradually picked up , qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks , rose to 16 months high , once climbed to 4@@ 36 yuan per ton , up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the beginning .
with the price rising , come along the concerns of various industries : will a number of small coal mines resume production ?
in this regard , kuang xian@@ ming , head of the economic research institute of the china ( hainan ) reform and development institute , conducted an analysis and interpretation .
kuang xian@@ ming : overcapacity cut rous@@ ed the high concerns to various industries . the report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed .
these three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change . that is , the government@@ -@@ led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed .
second , it is also directly related with the force of local government . during the overcapacity cut process , the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place . from this point of view , the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions .
thirdly , some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year .
in this case , relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact .
first , the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control .
our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity , promote the optimization of the structure and re@@ structure the new format of the entire coal industry .
during the process of overcapacity cut deploying , the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry .
second , in order to complete this year 's overcapacity cut task within this year , we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision .
finally , we should strengthen the role of social security .
because the market is directly related to the employment problem , we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees .

the two tribu@@ tar@@ ies will conduct construction via social financing . the charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments .
the old wan@@ fu river channel flows through jin@@ xiang , yu tai and then through the nanyang lake into the beijing@@ -@@ hangzhou grand canal main channel , with a total length of 3@@ 2.5 km .
according to the navigation needs , the old wan@@ fu river channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation . dre@@ dging was conducted on the local depth and curve cut@@ -@@ off on the local sharp bend . then the navigation conditions can be improved .
the channel flows through jin@@ xiang county , ren@@ cheng area and then through the nanyang lake into the beijing@@ -@@ hangzhou grand canal main channel , with a total length of 19 km .
the renovation project of the two waterway started construction in february 2011 . the delivery inspection was conducted in january 2015 . the investment construction and operation main body is jining city an@@ ping canal logistics service center .
in accordance with the " loan construction and charging for re@@ paying loan " principle , jining city an@@ ping canal logistics service center will collect channel tol@@ ls according to the charge standard approved by shandong provincial price bureau .
among them , the basic toll is 1.@@ 75 yuan / d@@ wt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan / km d@@ wt .
the toll collection date is from june 15 , 2016 to june 14 , 2019 .

ning ze@@ tao 's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi@@ -@@ final has made a lot of chinese audience speechless .
actually , this 50@@ -@@ meter freestyle is not the subject of ning ze@@ tao . his performance and best achievement in ka@@ zan world championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project .
sure enough , ta kung pao , an authoritative media in hong kong , revealed that the biggest reason for ning ze@@ tao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming .
many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas . he is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
after ka@@ zan world championships , ning ze@@ tao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance .
as a result , " national husband ( a good match ) " , " fresh little meat " , " gorgeous " , et@@ c@@ . have become his label .
a variety of business activities came to him . he really have a golden flashing prospect .
in this case , that ning ze@@ tao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle , is not only his freedom , but also a seemingly viable way .
after all , he is only 23 years old . after a certain degree of study , he can perform some tv series with his popularity .
but ning ze@@ tao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors .
at the 2000 sydney olympic games , the already 2@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old liu xuan came to the end of athlete career .
the beautiful appearance of liu xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle .
after retirement , liu xuan starred in a number of tv series , and in 2013 she set up her own studio .
tian liang participated in the single and double ten@@ -@@ meter match of two olympic games , and won 2 gold and 2 silver .
but when he was defeated by his counterpart hu jia at the single 10@@ -@@ meter match in the 2004 olympic games , tian liang 's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team .
but when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show " dad , where are we going ? " , he became a focus .
the once gold generation yang wei , li xiaop@@ eng and chen yi@@ bing all participated in a variety of variety show .
it is worth mentioning that , yang wei and li xiaop@@ eng led the chinese team and won champion in the 2008 olympic games men 's team . yang wei even got his individual all@@ -@@ around gold medal twice and was called as the almighty king .
and chen yi@@ bing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 olympic games men 's team .
but after he was mis@@ judged and lost the gold in the london olympic games , his mag@@ nan@@ im@@ ous act won him so many fun@@ s .
however , these game players mainly focus on the venue , they just touch and then go at the variety show .
however , no matter whether they are retired or active athletes , they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle .
after all , athletes have just stepped into a new area , so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection .
even for tian liang and liu xuan , who are not new in the entertainment circle , common people always think of their performance at the olympic games when mentioning them .
and the introduction of yang wei and li xiaop@@ eng at the variety show is always olympic games champion .
compared with these people , ning ze@@ tao is slightly weaker for the title of swimming world championships .
compared with these people , the title of ning ze@@ tao , a swimming world championship , is not so great .
moreover , compared with the withdrawal of tian liang , liu xuan and yang wei , et@@ c@@ . at their peaks , the withdrawal of ning ze@@ tao at 23 after some setback would cause im@@ measurable effects to the negative influence of his image .
after all , at the mention of athletes , people 's requirements on athletes are " not seeking victory but for no fear of danger " . ning ze@@ tao lag@@ s far behind from this point .
at the very least , ning ze@@ tao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans .
it is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training .
you have to listen to your inner voice on your life path . but as for how to choose , ning ze@@ tao should be quite conscious .
on the surface , the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people 's loneliness .
the sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact , but also gets down to the offline living circle , quietly changing the current social life of the people .
the benefits of online social network are obvious , convenient and quick , so it is particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people .
a survey of college students ' social habits shows that 57 % of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost inseparable to his mobile phone during their daily lives .
" social network features low cost , fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people . this meets the requirement of modern college students . "
expanding the interpersonal relationship circle , more equal dialogue , avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat .
new com@@ ers in the company love online exchange with colleagues . " we are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company . the likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another . "
people who love to make friends also love online communication . " i lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings . we became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting . "
it engineer wu yan is a profound social networking lovers . his majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends .
wu yan himself admitted that the network is more " in his element " .
" you can respond to your friends when you are willing , because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly .
" the communication hidden below one 's id can avoid interpersonal clash . this not only has room for maneuver , and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds . "
" people of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech . various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet . "
however , xiaop@@ eng , a friend of wu yan , thought that wu yan is a " very boring o@@ ta@@ ku . "
xiaop@@ eng and wu@@ yan meet each other in the group chatting . they two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers .
xiaop@@ eng thought that wu@@ yan is quite different from the one on internet . he is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views . his words are repeated like this , " oh , yes , right " , or " i will check it online " .

in late august , japanese prime minister shinzo abe will go to kenya to attend the 6@@ th african development conference , according to the evening news peak of voice of china .
the african development conference was dominated by japan , and the previous five meetings were held in tokyo , japan or yoko@@ hama , so this meeting will be the first move to africa .
japanese foreign ministry officials said the meeting held in africa will help to attract atten@@ tions of african and european countries to japan .
in line with the trip of shinzo abe , according to kyodo news agency , the japanese liberal democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned .
japan 's " application to become a permanent member of the united nations security council " began in the early 90@@ s of the last century while the afric@@ an@@ -@@ sponsored african development conference also began in 1993 . this is not a coincidence .
africa has 53 seats in the united nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the united nation . how can japan give up africa if it wanted to join the united nations security council ?
it will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of " islamic state " and terrorist activities .
" western group " will visit seven countries , including sierra leone , liberia and guinea bis@@ sa@@ u .
fum@@ io kis@@ hida , the current minister for foreign affairs of japan has also recently stated the intentions of the african development conference at the un security council .
abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub@@ -@@ saharan african countries , it will provide 100 billion yen ( about rmb 6.1 billion ) in five years .
observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind japan 's generosity toward africa : first , to increase japan 's presence in africa ; second , to win the support of african countries on the application to become a permanent member of the united nations security council .
" in terms of politics , africa is relatively lagging behind , but there are many african countries . so japan has always regarded it as the so@@ -@@ called ' big ticket field , ' " said yang bo@@ jiang , an expert for japanese issues .
japan will not give up in the future and its work on africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened .
economically , japan enjoys a strong production capacity , but its domestic market is relatively limited . in particular , the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population .
however , from juni@@ ch@@ iro ko@@ izumi , who was japan 's prime minister 10 years ago , to the present abe , japan has repeatedly launched the " sprint " scheme . however , all schemes were abandoned eventually .
yang bo@@ jiang believed that the inten@@ sion of japan to become a permanent member of the united nations security council is be clear at a glance . however , the road is bound to be full of obstacles .
to achieve its own goals , japan should firstly do a good job with the surrounding countries . and japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem .

a french couple ling@@ ered at the scene for almost 3 hours and experienced a lot in the mini flower card flow classroom .
" after knowing this special festival online , i decided to come and i felt quite fresh . "
they said , although there are similar festi@@ vities commemor@@ ating the ancestors , the atmosphere is quite solemn . but here you can enjoy music , food and also can learn traditional craft .
she said , " it is quite pleasant to see si@@ z@@ able and organized ancestor worship ceremony in such a busy financial metropolis of hong kong " .

" we do not want to make the bon culture festival very horri@@ fying , which may sp@@ ook people , especially the children , " said hu y@@ ans@@ ong , the chief responsible person of the event .

as the key performance project of " sino@@ -@@ latin american cultural exchange year " , from august 9 to 23 , china national peking opera theater performed seven opera in the mexican capital mexico city and c@@ ó@@ r@@ do@@ ba , ju@@ arez and other five cities .

i watched the performance of mar@@ issa jim@@ ene@@ z k@@ ach@@ ie accompanying her daughter in the peking opera performance 15 years ago .
" this is a fantastic performance . its music , lighting and stage performances are impressive to me ...... i think it is necessary to let her daughter understand the chinese culture and chinese opera art . "
the enthusiasm of mexican audience left a deep impression on the young actress of lady white .
" it never occurred to me that the mexican audience were so enthusiastic . i had some worries about whether they could understand the story , but it was beyond my expectation to see them catch the story and the laughter today .
qiu xiao@@ qi , the chinese ambassador to mexico , said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year 's " sino@@ -@@ latin american cultural exchange year " promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship .

liu ci@@ gui came to sanya for the research of " double restoration and dual city " and required to enhance the level of urban construction and management
in the morning of 12@@ th day of the month , liu ci@@ gui presided over a symposium , listened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of " double restoration and dual city " and the suggestions and comments of the relevant departments .
liu ci@@ gui provided fully affirmation for the stage results and good experiences and practice .
liu ci@@ gui stressed that sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and take the pilot work of " double restoration and dual city " as key content to give full play to the leading role of demonstration during the economic and social development in order to firmly grasp historical development opportunities .
we should lead to improve the internationalization of international tourism and enrich international elements and build international boutique from the details .
we should lead in the urban and rural integration and tourism , accelerate the construction of characteristic town and integrate tourism into each project and build each village and town of sanya into tourist attractions .
we should lead in " the 100@@ -@@ day social service investment move " and promote a batch of key projects and park construction to ensure the settlement of high@@ -@@ quality project and implement the various requirements of the big move .
zhang qi , the provincial standing committee and sanya municipal party committee secretary , wang lu , vice governor and lu zhiyuan , secretary general of provincial government participated in the research seminars .
in the 14 years of her sports career , deng y@@ aping won a total of 18 world championships , becoming the first chinese to win four olympic gold medals in china 's olympic history .
she ranked first in the table tennis for 8 years to maintain the world 's first and is a female athlete to rank as the " the world 's first " for the longest time in the history of table tennis .
on september 26 , 2010 , she served as deputy secretar@@ y@@ -@@ general of people 's daily , general manager of people 's search network co . , lt@@ d. and the department@@ -@@ level cadre .
recently , she will work together with yu min@@ hong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform .
there was also a team of star coaches in the chinese sports circle . they were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country . after retirement , they passed what they learned to the new com@@ ers and cultivated a great number of champions .
as the first world champion in chinese men 's gymnastics , huang yu@@ bin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement .
from the women 's team coach to the men 's team coach , to the head coach , huang yu@@ bin created an " olympic gold group " , and led to win 9 gold , 1 silver and 4 copper at the beijing olympic games .
since then , tian liang has been experiencing advertising endorsement . he has even served as a " co@@ wh@@ er@@ d " , " lei feng " and other important roles in recent years .
many nba players have proved their strength . but whenever there is progress , there is decline .
whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time , some players will have regres@@ sive performance each season .
of course , some " retreat " may only be data shrink , but the strength of these players may not have been reduced .
even if wade is still one of the league 's best line@@ back@@ er , his performance in the bulls is not so good as that of the heat .
the back@@ court range of he and lon@@ do is limited . the three@@ -@@ point hit rate of headed star butler is just 3@@ 2.8 % , making their next@@ -@@ season offence quite challenging .
after coming to feng cheng , the red star will definitely give the ball right to butler and ron@@ do and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season .
ok@@ a@@ for 's situation is more embarrassing . as the first choice of 76 people last season , he had to compete for playing time and ball right with sim@@ mons and en@@ by in the new season .
this competition may not come soon . sim@@ mons also need to adapt to the nba stadium , and en@@ bi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible , but whether ok@@ a@@ for can have a position in the long array of 76 people .
last season , 32 % of the score of ok@@ a@@ for comes from the low attack . such rate is higher than cousins , wu@@ chev@@ ich and brook lopez , while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league .
with sim@@ mons already showing a good point@@ -@@ forward poten@@ tion , en@@ bi also has a better st@@ ature more suitable for nba games and ok@@ a@@ for 's position is hard to be so solid .
over the past two seasons , thompson 's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career .
but the problem is , with the arrival of dur@@ ant , thompson 's appearance ratio will surely decline , which is bound to affect his play .
this effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots , thompson 's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced , which in some ways will reduce the opponent 's defense difficulty .
dur@@ ant 's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of warriors players , but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of thompson .
but this does not mean that the level of thompson steps backward . this is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole .
parker had a better performance than last season . this is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level , his chemical reaction with al@@ dr@@ ich also benefits the spurs .
duncan retired , gin@@ ob@@ ili announced a second battles for a year and the combination of gdp eventually came to an end . as one of the youngest among three people , the oil tank of french sports car is not much left .
after getting the third championship ring , only jab@@ bar , jordan and russell won more regular m@@ vp than that of james , while jordan was the only one who had more f@@ m@@ vp than that of james .
oh , yes , james has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in cleveland in the past 52 years .
coming to the 14@@ th season of his career , james needs to better con@@ serve his strength and get ready for the playoffs .
therefore , in the regular season , james 's capability is likely to further decline , he will give more weight to owen to bear , but he will still easily become the league 's top three players .
" i must carry forward what i learned in china to apply to russia " .
on the 12@@ th day of the month of the local time , huang jing , chairman of the moscow overseas chinese association said excitedly while she saw the reporter of chinane@@ ws@@ .@@ com .
not long ago , she participated in the " overseas chinese culture community chinese talent ( calligraphy , painting ) training " hosted by chinese state council overseas chinese affairs office and sponsored by jinan university .
while participating in the training course just now , she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy . as a result , after the end of the course , she has been able to draw and write her own works .
after returning back to moscow , i will use the knowledge and skills learned in china to russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the chinese culture .
at the same time , na yan@@ wei , the secretar@@ y@@ -@@ general of russi@@ an@@ -@@ chinese culture promotion association who also participated in this training course had the same feeling .
she said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the " overseas communic@@ ator of chinese culture "
she said , after she came back to russia , she would surely carry out the traditional chinese culture among the chinese and the russians who love chinese culture .

britain settle for silver in rug@@ by seven@@ s after fiji master@@ class sees them take gold
great britain 's impressive run in the rug@@ by 7@@ s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hur@@ dle by fiji in the final on thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 4@@ 3@@ -@@ 7 at the deodor@@ o stadium here in rio .
fiji gave a master@@ class in handling , off@@ -@@ loading , side@@ -@@ stepping , support play , running lines and bru@@ te strength to win gold - their first olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non@@ -@@ too sh@@ abby consolation of silver - britain 's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural olympic 7@@ s tournament in which they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa along the way .
the bru@@ ising beating of the bo@@ ks , 7@@ -@@ 5 in the semi@@ -@@ final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fi@@ ddle 15@@ -@@ man team .
it may be some consolation to gb - but probably not - that at least one brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : fiji 's head coach is ben ryan , the former england boss from wim@@ ble@@ don .
it has been some journey for gb .
eight years ago , under ryan , they lost every game at the adel@@ aide seven@@ s .
here , they lost just one .
this ham@@ mering will hurt but the progress is start@@ ling .
fiji started magnific@@ ently , boun@@ cing off gb tack@@ les for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain tom mitchell and co and the world series champions went 5@@ -@@ 0 up when o@@ sea kol@@ in@@ is@@ au di@@ ved over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock jerry tu@@ wai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12@@ -@@ 0 and gb had hardly touched the ball .
a superb mitchell tackle stopped the man@@ -@@ mountain leone na@@ kar@@ awa from scoring a third but it was only delaying fiji .
on seven minutes jas@@ a vere@@ mal@@ ua touched down in the right corner and gb were 17@@ -@@ 0 to the bad .
na@@ kar@@ awa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
va@@ tem@@ o ra@@ vou@@ v@@ ou then burst through some more lim@@ p gb tackling and stor@@ med to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29@@ -@@ 0 at the break .
it was as if fiji had been born to play 7@@ s , while gb are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
gb made wholesale changes at half@@ -@@ time and they plugged the fi@@ jian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first@@ -@@ half standards was good , until jo@@ su@@ a tu@@ is@@ ova went over after some brilliant fi@@ jian inter@@ play .
dan nor@@ ton grabbed a try for gb , touching down in the left corner to make it 36@@ -@@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the south sea is@@ landers whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire fiji 's whole joyful approach .
mat@@ a v@@ ili@@ ame iced the fi@@ jian cake that didn 't need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the fi@@ ji@@ ans embraced and gb hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , fiji had beaten japan 20@@ -@@ 5 in their semi@@ -@@ final and gb edged south africa in a tight semi@@ -@@ final of one try each - britain 's conversion the difference .
kyle brown put the bo@@ ks ahead in the first half but dan nor@@ ton with some dazzling foot@@ work broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from marcus watson , brother of england 's 15@@ -@@ aside team , anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
helen glo@@ ver and heather stan@@ ning inspired to rowing victory by coach 's cancer battle
there will not be a more emo@@ tive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing hea@@ ves into history , helen glo@@ ver and heather stan@@ ning found added meaning in their golden moment at the est@@ ac@@ io da lag@@ oa .
though they were the two pulling on the o@@ ars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach robin williams ever present as they powered to a second successive olympic gold in the women 's pairs , the first females in the ann@@ als of british sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39@@ th outing un@@ beaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
i had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don 't it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it al@@ ters your outlook a bit .
williams was diagnosed in december 2013 .
the tri@@ o were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
i needed to get paid so i had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
i was in hospital and i was walking around the ward - 20@@ ft , 30@@ ft 50@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that 's how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts were for williams , who had spent a ner@@ vy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxi@@ e@@ ties .
stan@@ ning , a captain in the royal artillery regiment with a tour of afghanistan behind her , said " i 've been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that 's a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . "
it just reiter@@ ates how much this means to me , how much me and helen have worked and robin as well .
it 's been a fantastic three years back with helen and robin .
without robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he 's the best coach in the world .
i couldn 't have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
helen glo@@ ver and heather stan@@ ning haven 't lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from new zealand and denmark began to close , stan@@ ning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
helen was calling ' stay in the process , stay in the process ' .
it 's really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren 't looking to do anything amazing .
we weren 't looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
glo@@ ver has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television advent@@ urer steve back@@ shall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i didn 't want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in london it took about six months to realise that i was an olympic champion .
it was all so new and i was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , " she said .

any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record .
snap@@ chat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting black@@ face or encouraging whit@@ ened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slan@@ ted eyes , distorted teeth and pu@@ ffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist car@@ ic@@ ature of asian people - " yellow@@ face . "
and they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on wednesday , with reports by the verge and mother@@ board , a day after snap@@ chat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hur@@ tful stereotypes in action .
others r@@ oundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , grace spar@@ ap@@ ani , a korean american art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was " hur@@ tful and uncomfortable to say the least . "
she added that " it 's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter 's effects .
it shows that the filter isn 't just yellow@@ face , but yellow@@ face taken to its der@@ og@@ atory extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company to cross these cultural trip@@ wires .
american culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boar@@ dro@@ oms to hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and snap@@ chat 's huge audience of younger people - who are more rac@@ i@@ ally diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of snap@@ chat 's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old katie zhu said in an interview on thursday , " it 's much harder for these types of things to go un@@ noticed like they did before . "
on thursday , ms. zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for medium , decided to delete her snap@@ chat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race@@ -@@ related controversi@@ es reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at snap@@ chat .
ms. zhu criticized the company 's mostly white , all@@ -@@ male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # dele@@ te@@ snap@@ chat .
" it 's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they 're able to make decisions like this , " ms. zhu , who is chinese@@ -@@ american , said , " or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they 're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . "
other observers share her view , a complaint that snap@@ chat has left largely un@@ answered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on thursday , snap@@ chat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recru@@ iter to focus on under@@ represented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , ms. zhu said she would keep her snap@@ chat account closed , adding , " i wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not o@@ .@@ k@@ . "
military officials distorted isis intelligence , congressional panel says
officials from the united states central command altered intelligence reports to portra@@ y a more optimistic picture of the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria than events on the ground warran@@ ted , a congressional panel said in a report issued thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the republican chair@@ men of the house armed services committee , intelligence committee and defense appropri@@ ations subcommittee , found " widespread dissatisfaction " among central command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctor@@ ing their assessments of american efforts to defeat the islamic state .
central command , known as cent@@ com , is the military headquarters in tam@@ pa , fl@@ a . , that over@@ sees american military operations across the middle east and central asia .
" intelligence products approved by senior cent@@ com leaders typically provided a more positive depic@@ tion of u.s. anti@@ terrorism efforts than was warran@@ ted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , " a news release about the report said .
" what happened at cent@@ com is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , " said representative ken cal@@ vert , republican of california .
the leadership failures at cent@@ com reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10@@ -@@ page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in central command 's description and analysis of american efforts to train iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doc@@ to@@ red , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from cent@@ com leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the islamic state , also known as isis or is@@ il .
" throughout the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and congressional testi@@ mon@@ ies were significantly more positive than actual events , " the report said .
for example , a cent@@ com official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back mo@@ sul could begin as early as april or may 2015 .
mo@@ sul , iraq 's second@@ -@@ largest city , remains under the control of the islamic state .
" after months of investigation , this much is very clear , " representative mike pompe@@ o , republican of kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the united states central command 's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command 's intelligence products to down@@ play the threat from isis in iraq .
republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the islamic state was being manipulated .
the report released thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of cent@@ com intelligence by the department of defense inspector general .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee released their own findings on thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task force .
" between 2014 and 2015 , cent@@ com created an overly insul@@ ar process for producing intelligence assessments on is@@ il and iraqi security forces , " representative adam b@@ . sch@@ iff , the committee 's top democrat , said in a statement .
this process , mr. sch@@ iff said , " stalled the release of intelligence products , " hurt morale among analysts and " in@@ sufficiently accommo@@ dated dis@@ sen@@ ting views . "
but mr. sch@@ iff and the democrats said they found no evidence that the white house tried to pressure cent@@ com analysts to fit their conclusions to a " pre@@ set or political narrative . "
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported tuesday by the daily beast .
last august , the new york times reported the existence of the pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by cent@@ com analysts .
lt@@ . cm@@ dr. patrick evans , a pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the defense department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general 's investigation continued .
but he said that " experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and department of defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . "
the investigation has repercus@@ sions beyond the question of whether the american@@ -@@ led bombing campaign in iraq and syria is succe@@ eding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of defense officials ) .
but last year 's allegations called into question how much president obama could rely on central command for honest assessments of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis spots .
the cri@@ ti@@ ques on the islamic state intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a cent@@ com intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of president george w@@ . bush , over many analysts " objections , advocated a small force in iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooker also played a key part in the insur@@ rec@@ tion over the islamic state intelligence .
last year , officials said , mr. hooker 's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , air@@ strikes against islamic state@@ -@@ held refin@@ eries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group 's finances because it had built makes@@ hi@@ ft refin@@ eries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside central command , the times reported in september .
cent@@ com 's commander then , gen@@ . lloyd j@@ . austin iii , came under criticism last year after senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and was replaced at central command by gen@@ . joseph l@@ . vo@@ tel .
u.s. wins 4@@ th straight in women 's field hockey , setting up show@@ down with britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6@@ -@@ 1 victory over japan , katie b@@ am scored the first two goals for the united states women 's field hockey team on thursday as the americans defeated india , 3@@ -@@ 0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but b@@ am , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
" i have no clue , " she said .
i 'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the americans are 4@@ -@@ 0 in the olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with britain , which remained un@@ beaten after defeating japan , 2@@ -@@ 0 , on thursday .
britain and the united states will meet on saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six@@ -@@ team bracket and who finishes second .
the first@@ -@@ place fin@@ isher will avoid the powerful dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however saturday 's game turns out , the americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the london games .
b@@ am was on that team .
she grew up in blue bell , pa . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at dre@@ x@@ el ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 olympics when she did not make the cut for the final ro@@ ster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , craig par@@ n@@ ham , an englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
" a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , " b@@ am said .
we didn 't have the work rate in london that we have now .
we 've made a complete turn@@ around .
on thursday night , b@@ am opened the scoring in the first half with a back@@ hand shot from close in .
india had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1@@ -@@ 0 until late in the third period , when b@@ am took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the americans a 2@@ -@@ 0 lead .
melissa gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez added the final goal mid@@ way through the fourth period .
the shut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the united states go@@ alie , jackie bri@@ ggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is b@@ am .
" we 're in a good place right now , " par@@ n@@ ham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of saturday 's game .
the depressing food of the depression , in " a square meal "
in march 19@@ 33 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , franklin del@@ ano roosevelt sat down to lunch in the oval office .
a gour@@ mand , president roosevelt had a taste for fancy fifth avenue foods like p@@ â@@ t@@ é de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and maryland ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
his menu that day was more humble : dev@@ iled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and , for dessert , prun@@ e pudding .
" it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , " jane z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man said .
her husband , andrew coe , added , " it was also a message to americans about how to eat . "
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights , are food historians .
mr. coe 's last book , " chop su@@ ey , " was about chinese cuisine in america , while ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man told the story of life in a lower east side ten@@ ement through food in her book " 97 orchard . "
their new , collaborative work , " a square meal , " which will be published tuesday by harper , is a history of american food in the great depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at eis@@ enberg 's sandwich shop , a tiny no@@ -@@ fr@@ ills lunch counter in the fla@@ ti@@ ron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while mr. coe , 57 , had the turkey , m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable med@@ ley .
when a reporter ordered meat@@ loaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of depres@@ sion@@ -@@ era eating .
" lo@@ a@@ ves were very popular , " ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
mr. coe gri@@ mac@@ ed .
" it must have sat in your stomach like lead , " he said .
in the years before the depression , the american table , especially in rural areas , was an all@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farm@@ workers , and fresh@@ -@@ baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was americans who had sent food to starving europeans during world war i. " a square meal " chron@@ icles the ways the nation cop@@ ed with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
" this was a time when food became a central , fra@@ ught subject for the american people , " mr. coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fra@@ ught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like lo@@ a@@ ves and casser@@ oles became sta@@ ples , the casserole a " wonderful way to re@@ purpose lefto@@ vers , " ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man noted , because cooks could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the american meal , became a spar@@ ingly ap@@ por@@ tioned luxury .
strange mas@@ hu@@ ps were tried as cal@@ or@@ ic and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
" it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , " mr. coe said .
ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man amplified : " it was sur@@ real . "
peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home@@ -@@ ec recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them louise stanley , chief of the federal bureau of home economics from 19@@ 23 to 19@@ 43 - drove the country 's eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become " budge@@ te@@ ers " and rise to the challenge of transforming glo@@ p like cre@@ amed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
" a square meal " is a feast of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
especially sav@@ ory are the accounts of the government 's response to its hungry citizen@@ ry , like president herbert hoo@@ ver 's let@@ -@@ me@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ -@@ cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he din@@ ed like the millionaire sophistic@@ ate he had become .
" he liked to eat continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , " mr. coe said .
he ate in almost a gold@@ -@@ plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fab@@ ul@@ ously out of touch .
president roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , mrs. roosevelt 's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a white house that " put out not only some of the dre@@ ari@@ est food in washington but also some of the most dis@@ m@@ ally prepared . "
many of the depres@@ sion@@ -@@ era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man 's mother - how she couldn 't throw food away , for instance .
" she had a real fear of food waste , " mr. coe said .
ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man recalled : " she actually got people sick . "
there was the cre@@ am@@ -@@ puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at eis@@ enberg 's , she and mr. coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prun@@ e dessert that president roosevelt ate for lunch .
" it 's called prun@@ e whip , " ms. z@@ ie@@ gel@@ man said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a sna@@ zzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prun@@ es , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn 't bad .
mr. coe went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can@@ -@@ do budge@@ ter , he told his wife , " some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . "
unfortunately , opec 's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in july continued to increase and saudi arabia 's output hit a new high .
the report cannot prevent the market from doub@@ ting the credibility of opec . oil recovery path is still bri@@ st@@ led with thorns .
on monday , opec chairman and qatar energy minister sa@@ da said opec will hold an informal meeting during the international energy forum on september 26@@ -@@ 28 .
the monthly report of opec on wednesday showed that the output of the entire opec organization in july , including gab@@ on , increased by 4@@ 6,000 barrels / day to 3@@ 3.@@ 11 million barrels / day .
opec also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refin@@ ers to produce more refined oil , thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market .
affected by this news , coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories , aggra@@ vating the excessive market supply .
as of wednesday 's close , the light crude oil futures of new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange fell by 2.@@ 48 % in september and the future price of crude oil in october in london brent fell by 2.@@ 07 % .
reuters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil@@ -@@ producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply . the data released by us energy information administration also suppress the market sentiment .
iran 's official news agency f@@ ars on wednesday , quo@@ ting the speech of z@@ ang@@ ane@@ h , iranian oil minister , said that iran 's daily crude oil production was up to 3.@@ 85 million barrels , which has been the highest level since 2008 .
at the release of the news of the meeting , the russian energy minister nov@@ ak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price .
it was april when the oil@@ -@@ producing countries had meeting . no agreement was reached among the opec member countries .
emma richar@@ ds , an oil and gas analyst at b@@ mi@@ research , said the market and the media could react excessively to opec 's meeting .
hel@@ ima cro@@ ft , head of commodity strategy at royal bank of canada , said opec changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement .
this means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people 's attention ( deliberately giving a false impression ) .
eu@@ gen we@@ in@@ berg , director of commodity research at the german commercial bank , said the possibility of opec trying to stabilize the market through the september meeting was low .
this is likely to further undermine the market confidence in opec . after all , this organization already staged a " wolf is coming " .

according to media disclosure , the large influx of capital into the internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product hom@@ ogeneity . investment boom fade gradually and capital came into the wait@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ see period .
according to the data of hong kong ai li pi hospital management research center , a large number of start@@ -@@ up internet medical companies langu@@ ished just within one year and about 20 % of the start@@ -@@ up internet medical companies has ceased to exist .
however , just as the majority of internet medical companies struggle in the road of a round or b round of financing , several sub@@ -@@ areas leading enterprises can still get the capital tou@@ ted .
it seems that the internet medical business shall not " swarm " , but to see the needs of the market , and be professional and profound .
yu@@ yue invested 12 million yuan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , while jiu@@ zh@@ out@@ ong invested 18 million yuan , accounting for 60 % of the registered capital .
in recent years , with the country providing policy support in the medical information , electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels .
the cooperation between yu@@ yue and jiu@@ zh@@ out@@ ong is aimed at the needs of the market , helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system , and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation .
unlike many internet medical companies which go in for gran@@ di@@ ose projects , i@@ baby focuses on the internet obstetrics vertical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors .
pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ one inquiry with doctors , but also pay for medical counseling .
at the doctor 's side , i@@ baby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture , peer exchange , case discussion and so on .
at present , three plates are set up for doctor 's client side , respectively , for doctors to continue education , social exchange and communication .
the following services are provided , including online learning , case discussion and academic exchange ; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department ; legal assistance , business support and other services required by doctor@@ -@@ patient relationship or personal life .
according to media reports , ceo wang lei recently said ali health " is willing to get down " to win big health data .
internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism . no unity can be provided on the same entry .
the layout of ali in the medical and health field is divided into three plates , namely , ali health , lyn@@ x pharmacy and alipay future hospital .
wang lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries , " this is not just how much money you have . in addition , it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness .
staying up late watching the olympic games will damage the heart easily
brazil olympic games is in full swing . even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in china , many people will stay up late to watch .
in this regard , the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular disease .
if you stay up for a long time , the hormone will have a lot of secretion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery . this may easily cause vas@@ o@@ constric@@ tion , blood pressure and thus cardiovascular disease .
han zhiyuan reminded people who have high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high blood lipids , smoking habits , family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may easily suffer from cardiovascular disease if staying up late .
if you stay up late , then your cardiovascular function will be affected , your gastrointestinal function , immune system , neuro@@ endocrine system will also be affected , and even the risk of cancer will increase .
for old friends , han zhiyuan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games , particularly those with cardiovascular disease .
during the last " world cup " football match , han zhiyuan received a 60@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old patient . his onset of myocardial infarction may be related with staying up late to watch games .
according to han zhiyuan , his department had treated some 25@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old myocardial infarction or stroke patients . this is largely due to long@@ -@@ term stay up of patients .
1 . do not stay up late every day . you can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the re@@ broadcast for other sports next day .
2 . you may drink more water , have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood clo@@ gging and enhance your body immunity .

during the cold war , the soviet union transported the missile into cuba , which almost led to the us@@ -@@ soviet nuclear war .
this event was seen as the pin@@ n@@ acle of the cold war , known as the " cuban missile crisis . "
but what is little known is that during the cold war , a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the united states against the soviet union . the incident has not been announced by the researchers until august 9 .
on may 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the us military in the arctic .
these rad@@ ars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the us , used for monitoring soviet missiles .
this paper was written by researchers at the university of colorado , who interviewed us military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non@@ -@@ confidential documents .
the paper wrote that in the 196@@ 0@@ s , in order to prevent the soviet union from suddenly launching nuclear war , the us air force has always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky .
us military commanders did not know that the culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the soviet union , so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state .
fortunately , the us military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the earth since the 19@@ 50@@ s , it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict .
later , he summarized the information provided by the us air force air meteorological service and submitted a detailed report .
the direct consequence of this solar storm is that the us military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system .

on april 27 , 2015 , the united states and japan jointly issued a new version of " us@@ -@@ japan defense cooperation guidelines " in new york , allowing the japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world .
this is the day the us defense secretary carter , us secretary of state kerry , japanese foreign minister fum@@ io kis@@ hida and japan 's minister of defense gen na@@ kat@@ ani attended the press conference in new york .
this is the fifth time that china 's civilian think tank has published the japanese military assessment report and the fourth launch of the english version .
the report is divided into nine chapters , including the overall policy adjustment , military strength , defense budget , military deployment , weapons and equipment , military system reform , military training , foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with china and so on .
the report said that the year 2015 is a phased last year of the abe government to promote major policy adjustments in the security area .
since then , japan 's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system , strategy implementation , policy implementation and other operational level , rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework , mechanisms and policies .
the report emphasized that the abe cabinet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the promotion of japan 's " normal nation@@ alization " , and the going@@ -@@ out of militia to intervene in international security affairs , strengthen japan@@ -@@ us alliance and prevent the rise of china and resist china .
previously , the china strategy and culture promotion council released the japanese military assessment report on june 5 , 2012 , july 19 , 2013 , july 23 , 2014 and june 30 , 2015 .
british " financial times " on august 12 released a group of pictures on mansion of us ambassador to china .
according to the article , in contrast , the appearance of the american ambassador 's residence , from the appearance of view , can be used as safety house in the cold war spy novels of john le car@@ r@@ é .
the residence is gray , and strongly for@@ tified by peripheral fence , the second interior wall , bar@@ bed wire entanglement and vehicle road@@ blocks .
improvement of public sports facilities
dark coal field warehouse is turned into a " green grass " football field while red brick sp@@ ire plant is turned into a modern sports museum .
on the national fitness day , nan@@ luo ma@@ ying sports culture park , outside the hangzhou wang@@ jiang gate , unveiled its mysterious veil .
it was a coal field once and remained idle for more than 10 years after its closure . a large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind .
after the renovation , it became a sports and cultural park , and will be officially opened in november to the public free of charge to provide sports venues . in addition , it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people .
this reminds people of hangzhou chen jing@@ lun school . this is a " wh@@ am@@ po@@ a military academy " in china 's swimming world , in which several world champions were born .
swimming champions will be produced continuously , producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports . the profound mass base provided a good condition for selecting professional players .
the level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports . athletic sports depend in a certain sense on national sports , and national sports depend on the conditions of the site .
according to reports , as of 2015 , the area of china 's per capita sports venues has been 150 times of that when the new china was established , but still far behind the sports power .
in june this year , the state council issued a " national fitness program ( 2016 - 2020 ) " and took the development of mass sports as a key content .
in order to fill the short board , on the one hand , the relevant departments shall take full account of the layout of the stadium at urban planning .
on the other hand , the already built public sports venues , including schools and other units in the sports venues , should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible .
the rio olympic games , which is in full swing , has stimulated people 's enthusiasm for sports , but also aroused everyone 's awareness of participation .
g@@ ile@@ ad to get attorney fees in hepatitis c patent fight with mer@@ ck
g@@ ile@@ ad sciences inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis c patent litigation with drug@@ maker mer@@ ck & co inc , a u.s. district judge has ruled .
in june , g@@ ile@@ ad was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two mer@@ ck patents related to g@@ ile@@ ad 's blockbuster drugs so@@ val@@ di and harv@@ oni , after a u.s. judge found a pattern of misconduct by mer@@ ck including lying under oath and other un@@ ethical practices .
in a filing on thursday , u.s. district judge beth lab@@ son fre@@ eman said that g@@ ile@@ ad was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
mer@@ ck is trying to catch up to g@@ ile@@ ad , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis c drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when g@@ ile@@ ad and mer@@ ck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying so@@ fos@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in g@@ ile@@ ad 's drugs .
u.s. backed forces say they have seized full control of man@@ bi@@ j from islamic state
u.@@ s.@@ -@@ backed forces have seized full control of northern city of man@@ bi@@ j near the turkish border after the last remaining islamic state fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on friday .
syria democratic forces ( s@@ df ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been hol@@ ed up in the city .
they had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants , shar@@ fan dar@@ wish of the s@@ df allied man@@ bi@@ j military council told reuters .
" the city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , " he told reuters .
clin@@ tons earned $ 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 , paid 3@@ 4.2 percent federal tax rate
hillary clinton on friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.@@ 75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 percent .
in 2015 , the clin@@ tons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the clinton foundation ; former president bill clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher simon & sch@@ us@@ ter for her book on her tenure at the state department .
clinton 's running mate , u.s. senator tim ka@@ ine of virginia , along with his wife , anne hol@@ ton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 percent in 2015 .
" hillary clinton and tim ka@@ ine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , " clinton campaign aide jennifer pal@@ mi@@ eri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , donald trump is hiding behind fake excuses and back@@ tracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for u.s. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
trump , a new york businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the internal revenue service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
" your move , " clinton campaign aide ian sa@@ ms said on twitter , linking to the democratic nominee 's returns .
on thursday , trump 's special counsel , michael cohen , told cnn he would not allow trump to release them until the audits are complete .
trump 's critics , including 2012 republican presidential candidate mit@@ t romney and other fellow republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with russia .
clinton has p@@ ounced on the issue , releasing an online video on friday highlighting high@@ -@@ profile republicans urging trump to release his taxes .
on thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in michigan .
" he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , " she told the crowd .
poli@@ tico has reported that trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 199@@ 0@@ s , and a new york times business columnist on friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor warren buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
president barack obama also backs the proposal .
at a clinton rally last week in oma@@ ha , nebraska , buffett , whose berkshire hath@@ away conglomer@@ ate is based there , challenged trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under irs audit and trump is " afraid " not of the tax@@ -@@ collection agency but of voters .
clinton 's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the clin@@ tons , who now live in chap@@ pa@@ qu@@ a , new york , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 percent .
the clin@@ tons ' 2015 return showed that , unlike most americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low@@ -@@ cost index mutual fund , and the clin@@ tons reported dividend and interest income of $ 10@@ 9,000 .

jewish film@@ maker slam@@ s berlin hotel for removing israel dial code after arab " request " - rt news
a french film@@ maker of jewish origin unle@@ ashed a media fu@@ ror after he revealed that the k@@ emp@@ in@@ ski bri@@ stol hotel in berlin does not list israel 's dial code , with employee citing " requests " from arabic customers .
claude lan@@ z@@ mann , an author of holo@@ ca@@ ust documentary " sho@@ ah , " ven@@ ted his frustration at the k@@ emp@@ in@@ ski bri@@ stol hotel in berlin , writing an open letter in the german outlet fa@@ z .
during his recent stay , lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in berlin , the capital of the new germany , that israel was eliminated and erad@@ icated ?
lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
instead , k@@ emp@@ in@@ ski bri@@ stol offers an opportunity to dial israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the film@@ maker addressed the issue at the hotel 's reception .
the answer he got there , lan@@ z@@ mann wrote " shocked him . "
the hotel 's clerk said that the measure was " a deliberate decision by the management of k@@ emp@@ in@@ ski@@ -@@ hotels . "
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the film@@ maker .
" the majority of our guests are arabs and they demanded israel 's code to be deleted , " the employee was quoted as saying by lan@@ z@@ mann .
israeli ambassador to germany ya@@ kov had@@ as@@ -@@ hand@@ el@@ sman called the case a " great shame , " sud@@ deutsche ze@@ it@@ ung reports .
we were app@@ alled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , " the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the k@@ emp@@ in@@ ski hotel simply " ca@@ ved in " to the alleged demands of arabic customers .
" shame on you , " another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble kur@@ fur@@ sten@@ dam@@ m street stands near a syn@@ ago@@ gue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an " oversight " and " apolog@@ izing " to lan@@ z@@ mann , der sp@@ ie@@ gel reports .
" there was never a direct order " not to include israel in the fast dial list , " sud@@ deutsche ze@@ it@@ ung quoted a k@@ emp@@ in@@ ski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas & rubber bullets against prote@@ sting brazilian students
students clashed with police in the brazilian city of sao paulo on thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dis@@ may at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of sao paulo ger@@ aldo al@@ c@@ k@@ min , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim president mi@@ chel tem@@ er .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en mas@@ se to support suspended president dil@@ ma rousse@@ ff as the country 's senate voted for her impeachment .
sco@@ t call@@ um sk@@ inner storms home as br@@ its grab cycling gold
scotland 's call@@ um sk@@ inner rac@@ ed to glory in the men 's team sprint at the rio vel@@ o@@ dro@@ me last night as the team gb tri@@ o defended the title from london 2012 .
the glas@@ we@@ gian 23@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old was in the anchor role that his fellow sco@@ ts@@ man sir chris ho@@ y made his own and the young@@ ster did the legend proud as he stor@@ med home to snat@@ ch victory from the fav@@ oured new zealand outfit .
britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as ho@@ y claimed the fifth of his six olympic gol@@ ds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a low@@ ly sixth at march 's track world championships in london , despite ho@@ y having since retired .
the issue between beijing and london was replacing specialist starter jamie staff .
they did so just in time as hin@@ des emerged .
ho@@ y 's retirement also created a void which ki@@ an e@@ ma@@ di and matt cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to fill .
sk@@ inner was the man britain 's coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the sco@@ t which has now been realised .
hin@@ des , kenny - champions with ho@@ y four years ago - and sk@@ inner set an olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was over@@ taken by new zealand in the first round .
and the british tri@@ o won the du@@ el for gold .
hin@@ des was narrowly behind after his lap , but kenny pushed the team in front and sk@@ inner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with hin@@ des riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow kenny and , in particular , sk@@ inner to keep pace .
ho@@ y watched on from his position as a bbc pun@@ dit and caught the eye of sk@@ inner , kenny and hin@@ des when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old sk@@ inner , from glas@@ gow , said : " it 's a flattering comparison . "
i 'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there 's no better way to win it .
after triumph@@ ing at london 2012 alongside kenny and ho@@ y , hin@@ des admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later re@@ tracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from britain 's rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
hin@@ des said : " it felt like london , with all the gb flags in the stand . "
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we 've been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both beijing and london .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ dro@@ me awa@@ its .
with the form kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating ho@@ y 's feat of winning three olympic gol@@ ds in one games .
that would see kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than ho@@ y , who is also born on 23 march ( that seemingly sacred date in british sport which is also the birthday of steve red@@ grave , mo far@@ ah and roger bann@@ ister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as ho@@ y 's .
kenny next compe@@ tes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old from bolton said : " i 'm just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it 's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
hin@@ des said : " if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a kni@@ gh@@ thood . "
it was the day 's only medal event , but there was further good news for britain .
sir bradley wig@@ gins , ed cl@@ ancy , steven burke and o@@ wain dou@@ ll qualified fastest in the four@@ -@@ man , four@@ -@@ kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 43 .
the world record , set in winning gold at london 2012 , is 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round and final ( 10.@@ 4@@ 2@@ pm ) take place on today 's second day of action , where wig@@ gins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commis@@ sa@@ ires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women 's event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , laura tro@@ tt , joanna row@@ sell sh@@ and , el@@ in@@ or bar@@ ker and katie archi@@ bald of mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie advanced in a world record time , c@@ locking 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
team gb have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an olympic games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional sho@@ wings of utter dominance at beijing and london , expectations have been played down in the lead@@ -@@ up to rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director shane su@@ tton in april amid sex@@ ism and bullying allegations , and the reti@@ re@@ ments of giant figures like ho@@ y and victoria pen@@ d@@ le@@ ton .
however , on the evidence of the first night 's racing in the vel@@ o@@ dro@@ me , it looks like gb 's now legendary reputation for pe@@ aking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
after the little baby came to this world , mom and dad shall be responsible for his life , not only for his health , but also for the development of his spirit , that is , education .
if such education failed , then no matter how successful your career is , you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure .

parents ' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents . and that is the so called , " like father , like son " . your son will be the same as you .
so we need to be a good example in front of children , regulate our words , cultivate our characters , which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character , so that he will become more excellent .

original title : the owner of a jiangsu farm was punished because he disposed of the 2,000 chicken without permission which were checked and detained by the court
after the verdict comes into effect , because lee did not automatically fulfill the obligation to determine the verdict , wang apply for enforcement to the shu@@ yang court .
on october 16 , 2014 , shu@@ yang court made a civil ruling , and ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall only be seized and shall not be transferred and sold without permission .
after lee received the detention ruling , without the permission of the shu@@ yang court , he privately sold partial egg laying hens .

on august 12 , reporters was informed that the beijing 2022 winter olympics and the winter paralympic organizing committee issued a notice that the beijing winter olympic organizing committee inherited the emblem and signs of beijing olympic winter games for commercial purposes .

the head of the department of industrial coordination of the national development and reform commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem .
china 's capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average , but also higher than that of the united states and europe and other countries and regions .
china has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the results are gradually emerging .
the official pointed out that the cpc central committee and state council should attach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity .
all departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the state council , earnestly carry out the work , and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year .
from china 's national conditions , china does not encourage steel exports . on the contrary , it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports .
the person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors .
the implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues . on the contrary , it will only cause further impact on the international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling .
as the iron and steel enterprises are lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale and involve a wide range of enterprises , the debt relationship is complex . it may lead to regional risks if disposed of impro@@ per@@ ly .
according to the person in charge , in recent years , with the economic downward pressure to increase , the total social demand gradually weakened , part of the industry capacity utilization decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased .
some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse . but restrained by some institutional factors , they become " zombie enterprises " due to many obstacles to the market .
the existence of these companies distorted market signal , reduced the elements resources use efficiency , increased the cost of social management , thereby hin@@ dering the establishment of market environment with fair competition .
the main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate .
china mainly adopts the market mechanism , economic means and the rule of law . the government is mainly to do the work of dis@@ closing the ins and outs to workers and social stability , to ensure fair and equitable market order .
the person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity cutting and ensuring the objective of resolving 100 million ton@@ s@@ -@@ 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years .

chinanews journalist found that there are at least nine provinces and cities issuing rules for the implementation of residence permit , including hebei , jilin , tianjin , jiangxi , sichuan , hainan , gansu , fujian and beijing , etc .
for the conditions of applying for residence permit , the above regions generally said that the applicants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements : having legitimate and stable employment , having legal and stable residence and continuous study .
chinanews journalist noted that in the aspect of residence permit providing treatment , the " gold content " is different in various cities . compared with the national provisions , some areas have provided more public services and conveni@@ ences .
these areas have increased the conveni@@ ences of children to attend college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement .
in addition , it is clearly proposed by beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience , and regularly release to the community .
for example , fujian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years
" residence permit provisional regulations " provides that , for those in line with the residence permit conditions , the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance .
for the time limit , most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version . that is , to release the permit within 15 days .
hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents , the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance .
jiangxi clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents , the public security shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance .
in accordance with the " residence permit provisional regulations " , the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of residence permit .
for example , sichuan required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies shall strictly enforce the approved fees and charges standard and resolutely prohibit over@@ -@@ range , over@@ -@@ standard fees or ride fees .
it was found that on july 27 , 2016 , chen yang@@ xia , the former ganzhou city ding@@ nan county party secretary came to the provincial commission for discipline inspection for reporting and serving as director of the cpc supervision room ( deputy director@@ -@@ general , one year 's probation period ) .

jiangxi provincial commission for discipline inspection informed that chen yang@@ xia and cheng z@@ iliang , who organized and accepted dining invitation in private clubs , violated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the party 's discipline .
last season , po@@ g@@ ba was punished with two yellow cards . he will be banned automatically according to the rules .

recently , bre@@ tt@@ -@@ brown , the comman@@ der@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ chief of the 7@@ 6@@ -@@ team gave sal@@ ic a high rating . he thought he saw the shadow of young manu@@ -@@ gin@@ ob@@ ili in sar@@ ic .
it is quite obvious that sar@@ ic already showed his gift and made 76 people full of expectations .
in croatia 's first two games of the olympic games , sal@@ ic received a total of 24 points , 17 rebounds and 12 assists .
in the first half , sal@@ ic showed his capability of drawing space on the scene . he can have a shot outside the three@@ -@@ point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues .
although the current 7@@ 6@@ -@@ team is packed with many gifted young players , they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as sal@@ ic .
from block shot to launching a long pass , fast break and complete assists , there are just a few insiders who can do it on the nba game .
since the beginning of this olympic games , sal@@ ic has obtained 13 points , eight back@@ boards and five assists in three games , with a full performance .
james has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the caval@@ iers in the summer of 2014 .
now , as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year , james will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of nba player union .
the substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol . the question is how the boss and players deal with the money . the outside world is worried that the nba will fall in the next summer .
but for james , he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3@@ -@@ year contract with the caval@@ iers .
no matter when the 201@@ 7@@ -@@ 18 season kicks off , james is within the contract .
since the stunning debut of i@@ phon@@ ese , the mobile phone market also ushered in a small screen machine boom .
not long ago , nu@@ bia also launched the first works of its z@@ 11 series : nu@@ bi@@ az@@ 11@@ mini .
nu@@ bi@@ az@@ 11@@ mini follows its consistent photographed gene , and is equipped with a one@@ -@@ hand eas@@ i@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ hold 5.@@ 0@@ -@@ inch screen , portable and convenient post@@ -@@ fingerprint recognition , contributing to its superior experience .
a small screen camera phone z@@ 11@@ mini , which was just listed by nu@@ bia , had a price fall of rmb 200 , decreasing from the original rmb 14@@ 99 to rmb 12@@ 99 .
in appearance , nu@@ bi@@ az@@ 11@@ mini uses a 5@@ -@@ inch 10@@ 80@@ p screen . the classic " little red circle " design is below on the front side .

portland smel@@ ter 's future in doubt with a@@ xing of power contract
the future of the portland aluminium smel@@ ter in victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant dis@@ closing one of the plant 's owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be a@@ xed .
the move follows the decision of the victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20@@ -@@ year fixed subsidy expires in november .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at alco@@ a 's portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock@@ -@@ on effects since the smel@@ ter consumes around 10 per cent of victoria 's entire electricity output .
in 2014 , alco@@ a closed the point henry smel@@ ter which led to the closure last year of the ang@@ les@@ ea power plant .
alco@@ a 's portland smel@@ ter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
ag@@ l , which supplies the big aluminium smel@@ ter with electricity from its lo@@ y yang a power plant in the lat@@ robe valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of alco@@ a and alumina , with china 's citic and japan 's mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i corp holding smaller shares .
" ag@@ l expects the portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smel@@ ter will continue , " it said .
ag@@ l said the contracts are so@@ -@@ called ' hedging contracts ' which were due to take effect from november 2016 .
the contracts have a 12@@ -@@ month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
" as such , ag@@ l continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , " the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on ag@@ l from f@@ y@@ 18 on@@ wards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
ag@@ l said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 18@@ 7 million in " anticipation of a termination event . "
alco@@ a said the decision to close out the contracts " does not affect alco@@ a 's ... ability to operate the smel@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the smel@@ ter . "
the us company said it entered into a 20@@ -@@ year contract with lo@@ y yang in 2010 , which was due to comm@@ ence from november this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the portland smel@@ ter in victoria and also the tom@@ ago plant near newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , ag@@ l 's head of operations , stephen mik@@ kel@@ sen said portland uses around 600 mega@@ watts of power annually and tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts .
if both of those plants go from the market that 's a significant reduction in demand in the [ electricity ] market .
and as a generator that wouldn 't be good for us , " he said .
community legal centres turn away 16@@ 0,000 people a year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the nation 's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector brac@@ ing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on al@@ ready@@ -@@ stretched operations .
in queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair ev@@ ic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are brac@@ ing for further cuts .
from june next year , those legal centres are sla@@ ted to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
director of community legal centres queensland james far@@ rell said the latest national association of community legal centres census report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
mr far@@ rell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
" queensland 's community legal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , " he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with un@@ manag@@ eable and crip@@ pling debts , families going through separation , workers who are un@@ fairly s@@ acked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they 're not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from june 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable queens@@ landers will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the attor@@ ne@@ y@@ -@@ general , and queensland senator george brand@@ is to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they 're faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it 's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government to invest in this important work .

britain must channel the olympic spirit and expand hea@@ throw
hea@@ throw will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across london , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of hea@@ throw , just as it was with london 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the olympics achieved huge benefits for strat@@ ford and the east end .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to hea@@ throw .
for our local communities alone we 'll create 10,000 new appren@@ tic@@ es@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of london 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of hea@@ throw expansion is too great .
i was told that britain would be never be ready for the games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on hea@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but hea@@ throw is answering every question asked of it .
like the olympics , hea@@ throw is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11@@ bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the uk .
we have a great team at hea@@ throw who have implemented an £ 11@@ bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from t@@ 5 - voted the world 's best airport terminal five years in a row , to t@@ 2 , built in the middle of the world 's busiest two run@@ ways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the london 2012 games were a great success for the uk and i am confident that hea@@ throw expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that olympic spirit and expand hea@@ throw , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that britain can be proud of .

woman run over on swiss motor@@ way in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motor@@ way in the early hours of thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the a@@ 1 near m@@ orges in the canton of v@@ au@@ d just after midnight on thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road " in a desperate act " and was hit by several vehicles , v@@ au@@ d police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a " logical " step in a situation like this , lawyer g@@ illes ho@@ f@@ ste@@ tter told le tribun@@ e de gene@@ ve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that 's what the prosecutor must determine , " said ho@@ f@@ ste@@ tter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motor@@ way in the dark - it was judged that mot@@ orists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the a@@ 1 near pay@@ ner@@ ne one night in august 2014 .
the 22@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the police@@ woman -@@ - who was responding to an emergency call -@@ - was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a " completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , " the judge said .
anyone with information about thursday 's incident near m@@ orges should call police on 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
nasa climate model : venus was once habit@@ able
venus was likely once habit@@ able , according to the projections of a new nasa climate model .
scientists at nasa 's god@@ d@@ ard institute for space studies developed a model to explore venus ' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not venus , with its hot , water@@ -@@ less surface and co@@ 2@@ -@@ ch@@ oc@@ ked atmosphere , might have once hosted earth@@ -@@ like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that venus ' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests venus could have bo@@ asted a thin , earth@@ -@@ like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dim@@ mer .
" in the g@@ iss model 's simulation , venus ' slow spin ex@@ poses its day@@ side to the sun for almost two months at a time , " g@@ iss scientist anthony del gen@@ io explained in a news release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than earth 's today .
the model produced a story of venus similar to the evolution previously hypo@@ thes@@ ized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habit@@ able , venus was -@@ - over the course of several billion years -@@ - exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its oceans evapor@@ ated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a death@@ ly greenhouse gas effect -@@ - thus , the venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new venus climate model in the journal geophysical research letters .
patrick roy re@@ signs as avalan@@ che coach
patrick roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the colorado avalan@@ che on thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team 's decis@@ ion@@ -@@ making process .
colorado executive vice president / general manager joe sak@@ ic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
" for the past three years , i have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the colorado avalan@@ che with energy , passion and determination , " the 50@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old roy said in the statement .
i have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how i might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and v@@ p@@ -@@ hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team 's performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
sak@@ ic , who hired roy on may 23 , 2013 , thanked roy for his contributions to the team .
" patrick informed me of his decision today , " sak@@ ic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
roy was named the jack adams award winner as the league 's best coach during his rookie season with the avalan@@ che in 201@@ 3@@ -@@ 14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first@@ -@@ place finish in the central division , but colorado was upset by minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the avalan@@ che posted a 39@@ -@@ 39@@ -@@ 4 mark in 201@@ 5@@ -@@ 16 and fell five points shy of the wild for the second wild@@ -@@ card spot in the western conference .
a hall of fame goal@@ tender , roy won four stanley cups -@@ - two ap@@ i@@ ece with the montreal cana@@ di@@ ens and the avalan@@ che .
north sea oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
labor strikes over pay for north sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negoti@@ ators said .
strikes against oilfield services company wood group have been staged spor@@ ad@@ ically on platforms in the north sea operated by royal dutch shell .
" wood group and the unite and r@@ mt unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , " a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full@@ -@@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood group this year cut rates paid to its north sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company 's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations in the wake of its mega@@ -@@ merger with british energy company bg group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation comp@@ ounded by the british decision in june to leave the european union .
scottish member of parliament dave anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the north sea in a generation .
the north sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
" in the north sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , " he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the north sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
ke@@ pler measures spin rates of stars in ple@@ i@@ ades cluster
the latest mission by the ke@@ pler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the ple@@ i@@ ades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
" we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star 's mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , " lu@@ isa re@@ bull , a research scientist at cal@@ tech 's infrared processing and analysis center in pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a news release .
the ple@@ i@@ ades cluster is situated 4@@ 45 light@@ -@@ years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they 're spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these mat@@ uring stars e@@ ject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars ' magnetic fields , they en@@ act a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
ke@@ pler measures each star 's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star@@ spots -@@ - like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
re@@ bull lik@@ ens the stars to dancers , larger ones pir@@ ou@@ etting more slowly than smaller ones .
" in the ' ballet ' of the ple@@ i@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rot@@ ators tend to be very light stars , " said re@@ bull .
because the ple@@ i@@ ades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
" the ple@@ i@@ ades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , " said re@@ bull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their ' dance shoes , ' so to speak .
re@@ bull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of ple@@ i@@ ades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the astronomical journal .
according to zheng jianjun , the management section chief of nanhu park water area , the deepest point of the south lake is more than 10 meters deep . people who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger .

civil rights group issues travel warning for missouri
the national association for the advancement of colored people has put out an alert for people of color traveling to missouri because of the state 's discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
" the na@@ ac@@ p travel advisory for the state of missouri , effective through august 28@@ th , 2017 , calls for african american travelers , visitors and mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable , race@@ -@@ based incidents occurring state@@ wide recently , and noted therein , " the group 's statement reads .
a recent missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits , as well as the state 's law enforcement dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert , the na@@ ac@@ p said .
" you have violations of civil rights that are happening to people .
they 're being pulled over because of their skin color , they 're being beaten up or killed , " the president of the missouri na@@ ac@@ p , rod chapel , told the kansas city star .
" we are hearing complaints at a rate we haven 't heard before . "
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the us .
the group cited incidents such as racial sl@@ urs against black students at the university of missouri and the death of tory sanders , 28 , a black man from tennessee .
sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state , and was taken into custody by missouri police without being accused of a crime .
the advisory also points to a recent report by the missouri attorney general 's office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites .
" the advisory is for people to be aware , and warn their families and friends and co@@ -@@ workers of what could happen in missouri , " chapel said .
" people need to be ready , whether it 's bringing bail money with them , or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state . "
missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the fbi 's hate crime reporting program , ranking the state at 16@@ th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .
the travel warning is also a response to a new missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the american civil liber@@ ties union ( ac@@ lu ) had issued travel advis@@ ories for texas and arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to de@@ tain people on immigration violations which the ac@@ lu said would increase racial prof@@ iling .
travel warnings are usually issued by the state department for other countries , but lately , advocacy groups have resor@@ ted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the us .

bbc claims that beijing has become the most exciting city : making foreigners feel like “ living in a new age ”
reference news network reported on january 18 that the british media organization has noticed that beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old .
the chinese capital is interconnected by amaz@@ ingly high@@ -@@ speed internet and has implemented cu@@ tting@@ -@@ edge technologies such as face recognition . it has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an un@@ matched capacity of internationalization . it is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world .
according to a report on the bbc website on january 16 , the german ex@@ patri@@ ate cle@@ men@@ s sage said : ' if i can succeed there , i can succeed anywhere . ' he quoted a song written by singer frank sin@@ atra to praise new york city .
sage , who served as creative director of traveler archives , said : " if sin@@ atra lives today , he is likely to sing a song for beijing . " he said that living in this city will make you feel like “ living in a new age ” , which means that you can always keep up with the trends .
simon nor@@ ton , who origin@@ ates from england had been living in beijing in recent years , published an article on personal blog site 4@@ corner@@ s@@ 7@@ seas saying : “ people generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand . although this feeling is hard to describe clearly , it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time . they want to see what it will become and hope to witness it . ”
according to reports , the city 's high@@ -@@ quality , high@@ -@@ speed internet and technology@@ -@@ friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before .
andy pe@@ ñ@@ af@@ u@@ er@@ te , who origin@@ ates from manila and is currently the deputy edit@@ or@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ chief of the website beijing children , said : " beijing is rapidly transforming into a cash@@ less society . the internet integrates the functions of traditional wal@@ lets into smart phones , making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions . "
according to reports , smart phones are just the beginning of beijing 's technical ambitions . face recognition technology is being widely used across the city . many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments , grant people access apartments and offices , and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car@@ -@@ ha@@ iling service .
beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.@@ 8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park . when it is completed , more than 400 companies will settle there . they will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biome@@ trics to self@@ -@@ driving cars .
food plays a central role in china ’ s many major traditional festivals . foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals . the spring festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense , and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners .

understand through a picture : bitcoin 's legal status around the world
abstract : a part from the price correction which is natural in speculation , the current round of digital currency tum@@ ble has also to do with the ' sworn enemy ' — regulation .
from the visu@@ alized maps , the attitude of the eastern countries towards bitcoin is more conservative than that of the west . most countries in the world are still in@@ decisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies , indicating that the “ risk of the black swan ” is still looming large .

as the authorities in major markets of bitcoin -@@ - such as china , south korea and the european union -@@ - take decisive regulatory measures , the digital currency market dominated by bitcoin has experienced major blood@@ shed this week . the price of bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar , recording the biggest one@@ -@@ day drop .
a part from the price correction which is natural in speculation , the current round of digital currency tum@@ ble has also to do with the ' sworn enemy ' — regulation .
at this important jun@@ cture , how@@ much@@ .@@ net , a visualization big data website , produced a map showing the legitimacy of bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world .
as shown in the figure below , green represents the legal market for bitcoin , and orange represents the neutral market . although there is no place where bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency , there are no major restrictions on the use it . the pale pink represents the restricted market , i.@@ e@@ . the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures . the deep pink represents countries where bitcoin is declared as illegal . the gray represents countries that have not yet been rated .
( the above figure was drawn by the how@@ much@@ .@@ net visualization team on january 15@@ th )
the article points out that from the distribution of non@@ -@@ green color patches in the graph , it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards bitcoin than the west .
russia is currently the largest country that defines bitcoin as illegal . china is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoin . india is one of the largest countries that have not commented on bitcoin and have not made relevant policies .
north america and western europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to bitcoin i.@@ e@@ . where green patches are concentrated .
the views of the countries in the middle east and latin america on bitcoin are clearly divided , so , the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed .
among them , iraq , iran , turkey and brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets . afghanistan , pakistan , saudi arabia , egypt , and bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoin . most latin american countries have not made any comments about bitcoin .
from the above data , it can be seen that of the 2@@ 46 countries that have been rated , a total of 99 countries ( or 40 % of the total ) haven 't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of bitcoin . they are represented by green and orange patches .
seven countries ( or 3 % ) are restricted markets ( pale pink ) , 10 countries ( or 4 % ) have defined bitcoin as illegal ( dark pink ) , and 130 countries ( or 53 ) % ) haven 't given comments on digital currency ( grey ) .
this shows that countries that account for the global majority ( 53 % , more than half ) are still in@@ decisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by bitcoin . this means that the “ black swan risk ” is still very large for bitcoin , because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies .
the article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency . this may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance .
although bitcoin ’ s popularity has grown expon@@ entially since last year , it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it . it 's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations .
wall@@ street@@ cn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against bitcoin across the world since last week , including : china starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile apps of over@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ counter exchanges ; south korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges ; the european union holds the view that bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “ losing everything ” .
wall@@ street@@ cn editor 's selection : reading news | 2018 : global central banks are u@@ sh@@ ering digital currency ? one article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world , viewing from the perspectives of supervision , acceptance / criticism and adoption .
the act of questioning the legal status of bitcoin by big countries such as russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies .

now trump 's white house is targeting the statue of liberty
the su@@ rest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .
americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully st@@ age@@ -@@ mang@@ ed top@@ pling of saddam hussein in fir@@ dos square in baghdad in 2003 .
stephen miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the trump regime , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the statue of liberty in a heated argument with cnn 's jim aco@@ sta over the president 's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration .
in fairness , miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat@@ -@@ trip owners and liberty imperson@@ ators would have lyn@@ ched him if he did .
but he did attack its meaning , and in particular the meaning ascri@@ bed to it when emma laz@@ arus 's famous poem was added to its base in 19@@ 03 , 17 years after the monument itself was completed .
as miller scolded aco@@ sta : " i don 't want to get off into a whole thing about history here , but the statue of liberty is ... a symbol of american liberty lighting the world .
the poem that you 're referring to , that was added later and is not part of the original statue of liberty . "
miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he put it himself , this is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of laz@@ arus 's start@@ ling words , the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " your tired , your poor , / your hud@@ dled masses yearning to breathe free , / the wret@@ ched refuse of your te@@ eming shore . "
there has never been a time when the " wret@@ ched refuse " has been more visible on our screens .
miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in trump 's usa .
this conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war : it is really a conflict about the meaning of america .
laz@@ arus - and her friends who campaig@@ ned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act .
the sculpture was intended to mark the connections between french and american republic@@ anism by representing in a well@@ -@@ worn classical tro@@ pe , the female embodiment of liberty .
laz@@ arus changed that meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on american na@@ tivism .
and just as laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , righ@@ tw@@ ing@@ ers have long wanted to change it back .
the great loud@@ mouth rush lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of john the baptist for the coming of trump , argued in 2010 that liberty is not inviting anyone in , but is rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on , taking the american flame out to the ben@@ igh@@ ted world : " lady liberty is stepping forward .
she is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the united states to the rest of the world .
the torch is not to light the way to the united states . "
rather unusually , lim@@ bau@@ gh actually hit on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception .
laz@@ arus 's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted , wret@@ ched but hopeful people on the dec@@ ks of ships after long and often dreadful jour@@ neys .
it is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives .
her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective miller and trump want ever to recognise .
their torch is meant not to light the way , but to inf@@ lame the hat@@ reds that are their only source of power .

world championships 2017 : neil black praises scottish members of team gb
e@@ il@@ id@@ h doyle recalls a time when only two sco@@ ts made the gb team
uk athletics ' performance director neil black says the 16@@ -@@ strong scottish contingent in the world championships squad will make " a massive contribution to the team . "
a record number of scottish athletes have been selected for london 2017 , which starts on friday .
black believes " there 's something special evolving " in scotland and uk athletics must learn from that .
" we embrace it and we 're trying to understand it and we 'll push on that until we work it out , " black said .
" i speak to people in the scottish institute of sport and they think it 's something to do with what they 've done .
scottish athletics think it 's something to do with what they 've done .
british athletics : it 's something to do with what they 've done .
and the guy on the corner street , too .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it 's absolutely brilliant . "
several of the scottish athletes are medal conten@@ ders , including laura mu@@ ir and andrew but@@ chart - who will race against sir mo far@@ ah in the 5,@@ 000@@ m , while e@@ il@@ id@@ h doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain .
" e@@ il@@ id@@ h is slightly modest .
her captain 's speech was incredible , " says black .
" a number of athletes , whether they were scottish or wherever they live or train , walked out of that room feeling hu@@ gely proud and really motivated .
the passion and real feeling that e@@ il@@ id@@ h naturally put into it were great . "
the commonwealth silver med@@ all@@ ist , who will compete in the 4@@ 00@@ m hur@@ dles at her fifth world championships , says it 's " incredible " 16 sco@@ ts are in the british team .
scotland 's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
middle@@ -@@ distance runner mu@@ ir is leading the way , having set five british and two european records in the past year .
she will go in the 15@@ 00@@ m and the 5,@@ 000@@ m .
chris o '@@ hare , who runs in the 15@@ 00@@ m , is another sco@@ t to watch , following a great season that included victory at the british team trials and the anniversary games .
doyle remembers her first world championships , when the only other sco@@ t in the team was lee mc@@ conn@@ ell .
the team captain says she 's " hu@@ gely proud " of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team , but , in some cases , will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals .
" the special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team , so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra@@ -@@ special for me , " she added .
" obviously , i 'm very proud of all the sco@@ ts who 've made the team .
it just shows how far we 've come .
and they 're here as well@@ -@@ established athletes , athletes that are going to be looking to get on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my captain 's speech ?
yeah , i think it went well .
i just drew on the fact that we 're very lucky in this situation in that we 've got a home world championships .
so it 's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we 're back at the olympic stadium .
i 'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it 's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there . "

blocking critics from facebook : don 't run for public office , if you can 't take heat from voters
the father of our country knew something about bad press .
americans loved george washington , but it didn 't take long for newspapers to start slam@@ ming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .
he ch@@ af@@ ed at the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
because back in 17@@ 83 , washington said , " the freedom of speech may be taken away - and , dumb & silent we may be led , like sheep , to the slaughter . "
that brings me to maryland gov@@ . larry ho@@ gan , who needs to work on being more like washington .
ho@@ gan 's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official facebook page .
and the american civil liber@@ ties union sued him for that earlier this week .
the governor 's staff dismissed the lawsuit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was rich with a " who cares ? " back@@ lash .
" it 's only facebook , " plenty of folks said .
but it matters .
and it especially matters when it 's a guy like ho@@ gan .
this is a republican governor in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state who is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second@@ -@@ highest approval rating of the nation 's 50 governors .
ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tionary ho@@ the@@ ad .
he 's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles .
he 's also been pretty de@@ ft at using facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents , play@@ fully debu@@ ting his hair@@ less head after chem@@ o treatments on his page .
so blocking people who come to the governor 's page - which is a public forum , labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with the washington post , ho@@ gan spokeswoman amel@@ ia chas@@ se defended the governor 's actions , arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moder@@ ating them .
but it 's too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ am@@ mers or hateful folks l@@ ashing out online .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by ho@@ gan .
and they 're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , a business owner and a pastor , not tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor quoted the bible in his post , appealing to ho@@ gan 's catholic faith .
attorney la@@ k@@ sh@@ mi s@@ arma ra@@ mani of bo@@ wie , md . , wasn 't hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .
" i politely commented that i was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items , " she wrote in the comment section of the post 's news story .
" i also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic , they are immediately dis@@ regarded by some as a so@@ -@@ called collective effort , rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens . "
what the governor 's staff called a " concentrated spam attack " others would probably call " advocacy . "
the facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .
it 's a lot cleaner than the old days , when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical edit@@ ori@@ als or arresting and sil@@ encing protesters .
but that 's exactly what 's happening , only digit@@ ally .
ho@@ gan isn 't the first public official to be criticized for def@@ ang@@ ing facebook and other social media .
president trump is being sued by twitter users who were blocked from his twitter feed .
one of the first landmark rul@@ ings on this issue came down last week in virginia .
the chair of the lou@@ dou@@ n county board of supervisors violated the first amendment , according to u.s. district judge james c@@ . ca@@ cher@@ is in alexand@@ ria , when she banned a constituent from her facebook page .
and in kentucky , gov@@ . matt be@@ vin ( r ) also got a visit from the ac@@ lu over his use of facebook and twitter .
this shouldn 't be so hard .
in washington 's time , the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the internet .
the number of newspapers quadru@@ pled between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers ham@@ mered his leadership .
and even back then , washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
people using the pseud@@ onyms " jur@@ ic@@ ola , " " val@@ er@@ ius , " " bel@@ is@@ arius , " and " por@@ ti@@ us " all wrote letters to newspapers tr@@ ashing washington 's decisions .
peti@@ tions criticizing his stand on the treaty of am@@ ity , commerce , and navigation with britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of george washington project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensi@@ b@@ ilities of the general public .
purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures .
in may 2017 , jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecu@@ tively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent resi@@ dency .
in june , wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit .
after the policy was enhanced , officials stated that “ university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20 % discount to market price ” .
in july , chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor ’ s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in chengdu based on their graduation certificate .
in addition , kunshan , ling@@ ang in shanghai , as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “ talent introduction ” policies , and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents .
zhang hongwei believed that this was , in fact , large cities competing for population , particularly talent . only by retaining population , particularly talent , can a city be competitive . this then , was the key significance of these real estate policies .
some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “ purchase quotas ” .

zou shou@@ min , director of the bureau of environmental supervision of the ministry of environmental protection , said on the 22@@ nd in beijing that on a nationwide basis , 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines . the newly amended “ environmental protection law ” , implemented at the beginning of this year , has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in china .
presently , the environmental protection bureaus across china may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines , close down operations and / or di@@ strain , limit or suspend production , and persons held under administrative detention . they will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes .
zou shou@@ min said that in august , a total of 3@@ 35 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and / or di@@ strain ; 17@@ 7 cases per@@ tained to limiting or suspension of production ; 18@@ 9 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention ; and 16@@ 6 cases per@@ tained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes .
in particular , henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases . at present , china is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process , intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all@@ -@@ round basis .
although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged , china ’ s ministry of environmental protection had already made its position clear ; china should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth , and increase “ green determination ” . the more economic growth deceler@@ ates , the more it should hold fast to environmental protection , and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy .

a new batch of water samples were just finished being collected , liu rui and his colleagues were immediately busy .
at the same time as the daily monitoring ,
they are trying to tackle the smart management of rural sewage this year .
how to manage it well , in fact , it is a very serious challenge .
the institute of ecology and the environment , tsinghua yangtze river delta research institute in zhejiang province is located in jiaxing , the birthplace of the red boat spirit .
from nothing more than a dozen years ago to the present ,
the research institute of the yangtze river delta of tsinghua in zhejiang province has developed into a platform with three key national level innovations . nearly 400 overseas students have settled in this region to gather power for innovation in zhejiang province .
the spirit of the red boat is a force that we must follow and understand . innovation is actually very difficult .
there is a lot of frustration behind all innovations in this area ,
none of them can be solved . at this stage , you have to stick to it and keep going .
previously , ordinary people asked for help , but now , officials have come to help . that is
to do real things for the people .
up to now , in this way , xiaoshan district collected a total of 5,@@ 9@@ 85 issues , of which 3,@@ 8@@ 68 were solved and 1,@@ 4@@ 96 were in the process of being handled .
our agents in zhejiang province have a saying that goes

they went deeply into the grassroots mass art museums , local academ@@ ies and some colleges and universities in inner mongolia , as well as heilongjiang and gansu provinces to conduct a profound interpretation of the new cultural mission
i am deeply proud and happy , and i am willing to go down and write more about the fate of the normal people in the major times .
on the development of grassroots literature and art .
nowadays mass literature and art are very popular , there is a little popularity ,
and continue to launch quality works worthy of the times .
it should be rooted at grassroots and in@@ -@@ depth lives , with a certain substance of culture that is positive , with long@@ -@@ lasting artistic works that hold charm .
the actual contracted area has reached 1.@@ 52 billion mu , of which 1.@@ 11 billion mu has been completed .

the first satellite in china 's space science satellite series and the world 's first dark matter particle detection satellite , wu@@ kong ,
conducted four scans of an area all@@ -@@ day in the past two years during orbit and detected more than 3.5 billion high@@ -@@ energy particles . it obtained the most accurate
this achievement has recently been published in nature , an international academic journal .
in space , we observe that such a new observation that has not been observed before , which cannot be explained or illustrated by existing theories ,
the significance of this result is diverse . above all , it shows the ability of chinese scientists to use the most cu@@ tting@@ -@@ edge technologies
to make scientific instruments to probe a very difficult scientific issue .
find the toilet by the nose , in the last century , this is memory that many chinese are fond of .
but also incorporates more humanized designs .
impressed so many tourists . the toilet has ventilation all year around without a peculiar smell .
we no longer need to rely on the nose to find the toilet .
we should not only change the hardware , but the software must also keep up .
the tourism department requires that toilets at famous sites should be equipped with toilet paper and hand san@@ i@@ tizer .
but in some areas ,
whether to stop this convenient service or not due to the uncivilized behavior of individuals
was decided by managers from all areas who have made their choice .
on the one hand , through civilized prompts to promote conservation , on the other hand , they also carry out technological innovation .
in public toilets in places like nanjing and su@@ cheng in jiangsu province ,
by scanning your face for three seconds , you can get a free copy of the toilet paper , but if you want to get double copies , you need to wait ten minutes .
this avoids the abuse of public resources .
habits . some tourists may indeed think of taking the paper back , but on the other hand , we must reflect on this situation .
is there paper in the next toilet for tourists to use ? this is what we highlighted in the new three@@ -@@ year plan .
to solve this problem of in@@ adequacy and imbalance
and to push the revolution in toilets further , we should think more of what the masses think .
to have a third toilet to facilitate family members to accompany the elderly and children to the rest@@ room .
we take our baby to the men ’ s room and we are embarrassed ,
but when w go to the ladies ’ room , babies are so small that we also feel a bit embarrassed . that board is particularly comfortable , it is convenient for those who have children .
people feel more civilized and have become civilized builders . in the villages , villagers in he@@ chi , guangxi , are creating flushing toilets in their homes ,
great achievements have been made and the active promotion of the toilet revolution does not only help people stay away from disease , but also promotes economic development to narrow the regional development gap .
this toilet problem is an issue of expos@@ it@@ ory themes , it is a node of the social development .
it is a national civilized project that leads from the national point of view to the layout , and then takes part in all aspects to solve the small social problems with varying degrees of participation .
in this way , we can make up for all shortcomings .
with the recent commencement of construction of jin@@ xi irrigation district in heilongjiang province , this year began with a major water conservancy project across the country and has reached 14 items .
the investment scale reached 900 billion yuan .
at present , the enrollment rate of compulsory education for juvenile children in three categories of children with vision , hearing and intelligence disabilities in our country has reached over 90 % .
xicheng high speed rail that links the high speed rail between xi ’ an and chengdu was launched on december 6 , with tickets for the first train being sold and then scheduled the train after the diagram adjustment at the end of the year that is available today .

of the spirit of chinese culture .

poverty and death in indonesia 's land of gold
when bar@@ dina de@@ ge@@ i cooks dinner , she doesn 't use a stove .
she rarely even uses a pot .
in her wooden home in en@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i , the capital of pan@@ i@@ ai re@@ gency in the res@@ tive indonesian province of papua , the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as " no@@ ta " - directly into the fireplace .
after half@@ -@@ an@@ -@@ hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is retrieved and dev@@ oured with eager , un@@ washed hands .
de@@ ge@@ i sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores , such as washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby swamp .
a bucket in a roo@@ fl@@ ess room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband 's four wives , she has been assigned no fields to tend .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , working late can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily , plus there are the soldiers .
" no one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.@@ m. , " she says .
it 's a rare glimpse of daily life in the high@@ lands of papua , a former dutch colony that was absorbed into indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum , when just 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops .
an existing movement ag@@ itating for independence against dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the jakarta government , which maintains tight control over the region , bar@@ ring foreign journalists or rights monitors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into papua and west papua , with independent papua new guinea occupying the eastern part of the island .
en@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i is as remote as it is desolate ; the journey here involves a 90@@ -@@ minute flight from the provincial capital ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ura to nab@@ ire , and then a stomach@@ -@@ chur@@ ning five@@ -@@ hour drive by hire car .
there is no public transport .
the town of some 19@@ ,000 people consists of wooden houses ring@@ ed by bamboo f@@ encing , corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying ta@@ wn@@ y shades .
very few indones@@ ians have made the journey here , let alone journalists , and practically no foreigners .
before christian mission@@ aries arrived , me@@ e p@@ ago pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shi@@ ped a god named ug@@ a ta@@ me@@ e .
there were other changes , too .
" we were not used to wearing these clothes , " says de@@ ge@@ i , indicating her vividly colored , hand@@ -@@ woven tur@@ ban , dark shirt and a bright skirt .
" before , we only wore leaves on our bodies . "
papua is indonesia 's poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in asia .
but it is also indonesia 's land of gold .
the world 's largest and most profitable gold mine , gras@@ berg , owned by phoen@@ ix@@ -@@ based free@@ port mc@@ mor@@ an , lies just 60 miles from pan@@ i@@ ai , a highland province around the size of new jersey and home to 15@@ 3,000 people .
in 2015 alone , free@@ port mined some $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here .
in addition , papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for pap@@ u@@ ans , ensuring indonesia 's powerful military maintains a suffoc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 investigation in the new york times reported that free@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .
pap@@ uan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose , and are dealt with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to rights activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ u@@ ans have been killed , and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the indonesian military since 1969 .
mass killings in papua 's tribal high@@ lands during the 197@@ 0@@ s amounted to genocide , according to the asia human rights commission .
indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone .
we will lose everything , a 2016 report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of bris@@ bane , contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial execu@@ tions , torture - rape and electro@@ cu@@ tion are especially popular , according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations .
" it 's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week , " says andre@@ as har@@ son@@ o , indonesia researcher for human rights watch .
the screws have tightened as papua 's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in indonesia .
the province 's 3.5 million population is 83 % christian , but the demographic is changing as muslim economic migrants arrive from indonesia 's populous islands of java , bor@@ neo , su@@ mat@@ ra and su@@ law@@ esi .
jav@@ anese war@@ ung can@@ teens sell fried chicken and gad@@ o@@ -@@ g@@ ado mix@@ ed@@ -@@ vegetables served with peanut sauce .
local people struggle to compete .
" the migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ u@@ ans , " explains abeth you , a 24@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ura for work .
" it made the native pap@@ u@@ ans - the ma@@ ma@@ -@@ mama [ the women ] of papua - lose their market . "
indonesian president jo@@ ko wido@@ do , popul@@ arly known as jo@@ kow@@ i , vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in papua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carpenter secured 27 of papua 's total 29 districts - including pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in jakarta .
but precious little has changed in papua , and today local people feel betrayed .
" our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for jo@@ kow@@ i , with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored , " you says .
in fact , pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a na@@ di@@ r just two months after jo@@ kow@@ i 's october inauguration .
on dec@@ . 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in en@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i when two indonesian soldiers on a motor@@ bike broke through the gloom .
the startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights .
one of the soldiers took um@@ bra@@ ge at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to local pastor ya@@ ved@@ t te@@ bai .
the soldiers , who had been drinking , chased and beat the group with their rifle but@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old yu@@ lian@@ us ye@@ imo , was beaten so badly he fell into a coma .
a couple of hours later , the nearby government election commission building was set ab@@ la@@ ze , and things escal@@ ated the following day .
about 1,000 young pap@@ uan men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice .
they carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and simulating bird@@ song - of papua 's me@@ e p@@ ago tribe .
some protesters started hur@@ ling stones at police and military posts .
as temper@@ s grew more heated , an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio : " if the masses offer resistance more than three times , shoot them dead , " it said , according to an official document seen by time that has not been released to the local media .
ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as ka@@ ya@@ me , 56 , the head of the ke@@ go ko@@ to neighborhood of en@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i , saw the im@@ pending danger and appealed for calm , impl@@ oring the crowd to go back home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
" when i turned around i suddenly got shot in my left wrist , " he told time on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house .
ka@@ ya@@ me still doesn 't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of am@@ assed soldiers .
" it was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .
local man al@@ fi@@ us you@@ w was hit three times , according to his cousin who witnessed the shoo@@ tings .
" i ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him , " yo@@ han@@ es , who like many indones@@ ians only goes by one name , told time som@@ ber@@ ly .
" i saw he was dead ... i kissed him . "
the papua police chief inspector general yo@@ t@@ je men@@ de told reporters that his officers were only " securing " their station because it was under attack .
" we have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " papua police spokesperson , commissioner pud@@ jo su@@ lis@@ ti@@ yo said in 2015 .
" it 's a matter of life and death . "
according to human rights watch , five young protesters were killed and many more injured .
news of the killings only filtered through to jakarta the following day .
three weeks later , jo@@ kow@@ i gave an imp@@ assi@@ oned speech in ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ura , where he expressed sympath@@ ies with the victims ' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in papua .
" i want this case to be solved immediately so it won 't ever happen again in the future , " he said .
security minister w@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in october 2016 that he was setting up a non@@ -@@ judicial mechanism to settle historic human@@ -@@ rights violations .
but the excuses started almost immediately .
" most of the violations occurred a long time ago .
some were in the ' 90@@ s and in early 200@@ 0@@ s .
the point is we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , " he said .
then w@@ ir@@ an@@ to back@@ tracked when speaking to time in jakarta on june 5 , saying he has no plans to establish a griev@@ ance mechanism in papua .
instead , " all will be settled by law , " he said .
w@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who the u.@@ n@@ . has indic@@ ted for " crimes against humanity " relating to more than 1,000 deaths during east tim@@ or 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human@@ -@@ rights violations in papua have already been settled , including the pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the pan@@ i@@ ai victims greeted such claims with grim incre@@ dul@@ ity .
" i 've been interviewed four times for the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , " yo@@ han@@ es says .
" i 'm tired . "
he says that years later , he still lives in fear .
" i 'm afraid , " he says .
" i 'm afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . "
his brother y@@ aco@@ bus echoed the view that people in pan@@ i@@ ai are fearful of discussing the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
" after bur@@ ying the bodies , the military came looking for me , " he says .
the shoo@@ tings haven 't stopped .
on tuesday , indonesian police shot at villagers in pan@@ i@@ ai 's neighboring de@@ i@@ y@@ ai re@@ gency .
one person died and 17 others were wounded , including children , during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital .
the man , 24@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old ra@@ vi@@ anus dou@@ w who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
incen@@ sed villagers protested in front of the company 's site office .
police said the villagers threw rocks at officers , who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say the mobile brigade ( indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd , killing one .
" we were so panicked , we are afraid there will be revenge , " 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old dom@@ ing@@ gu ba@@ dii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in , tells time .
" i have been hiding in my house for two days . "
the de@@ i@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area .
pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a troubles@@ pot for the indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal me@@ e , mon@@ i , dan@@ i , and dam@@ al peoples , who live spra@@ w@@ led across papua 's ver@@ dant central high@@ lands .
many joined the free papua movement ( op@@ m ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the pap@@ u@@ ans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping ra@@ ids on indonesian soldiers .
some of the top op@@ m leaders hail from pan@@ i@@ ai , including ta@@ di@@ us yog@@ i and daniel yud@@ as ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people in pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years , under the gu@@ ise of " safeguarding national sovereignty . "
some never re@@ appear .
among the people of papua , pan@@ i@@ ai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place . "
poverty feeds the discontent .
the little rice on sale in en@@ ar@@ o@@ tal@@ i is too expensive for locals to buy .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here grow everything they eat : mainly no@@ ta plus some fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
farming is the job of the women , who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they usually keep most of the harvest for the family , with the rest sold in the local market .
ten pieces of no@@ ta cost only 10,000 indonesian ru@@ pi@@ ah ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have grown between the native pap@@ u@@ ans and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to nab@@ ire airport .
what few jobs exist typically go to the better@@ -@@ educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
pap@@ u@@ ans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competi@@ tively .
" the young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there 's no jobs or money here , " says john go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal council of pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the world 's eyes off papua .
in addition , reporting restrictions for international media remain tight .
earlier this year , french journalists franc@@ k es@@ cu@@ die and bas@@ ille long@@ champ were de@@ ported from papua for a " lack of coordination with related institutions " despite having been granted rare permission to film .
according to phel@@ im k@@ ine , deputy asia director of human rights watch , jo@@ kow@@ i 's election campaign ple@@ dges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized .
" there are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from indonesia 's res@@ tive ea@@ ster@@ n@@ most provinces of papua and west papua : visa denial and black@@ listing , " he said in a statement .
the lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the indonesian government has been largely limited to papua 's immediate neighbors .
in march , six pacific nations - tong@@ a , na@@ ur@@ u , pal@@ au , tu@@ val@@ u , the marshall islands , and the solomon islands - urged the u.@@ n@@ . human rights council to investigate the " various and widespread violations " in papua , including the pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
these same countries have historically backed the op@@ m .
indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a nas@@ ir shru@@ gged off the group 's allegations , telling journalists in jakarta , " in indonesia , a democratic system still applies and there 's free media so it 's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up . "
local people want more foreign governments to take note .
when an official delegation from the netherlands , headed by the nation 's human rights ambassador kees van ba@@ ar , visited ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ura on may 4 , local people broke their silence , bes@@ ee@@ ching , " we want freedom , " according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous .
indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but pap@@ u@@ ans say they are unlikely to vote again for jo@@ kow@@ i .
" jo@@ kow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shooting , " says go@@ bai , the tribal council chairman .
he wants jo@@ kow@@ i to know that the pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from living under the looming threat of a rap@@ acious military , wal@@ low in des@@ titu@@ tion , with pal@@ try education and health services .
go@@ bai says the pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other pap@@ u@@ ans , consider their vote to jo@@ kow@@ i as a " debt " he must repay .
" they don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .
despite the threats and intimidation , families of the pan@@ i@@ ai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of de@@ fiance : bur@@ ying one victim 's body on land just opposite the police and military station .
knowing that justice may never be served , at least they won 't let those responsible forget their crimes .
" a member of our family has been killed , " says y@@ aco@@ bus , head bowed .
" what else could we do ? "
brands such as suo@@ fei@@ ya , holi@@ ke and top@@ strong have lever@@ aged the strength of capital to actively grow their business in the customized home furnishing industry . on february 10 , 2017 , the china securities regulatory commission ( csrc ) approved the ipo application of guangzhou shangpin home collection co . , ltd . , and issued a listing permit on the small and medium enterprise board of shenzhen stock exchange . more than 20 days ago , op@@ pe@@ in home group received approval for its ipo .
industry insiders believed that with the listings of shangpin home collection and op@@ pe@@ in home group , the customized home furnishing sector , which was already soaring , will turn from production competition to competing for capital .
at the beginning of the new year , when shangpin home collection ’ s ipo was first approved , news of the listing of this classic brand , which represented the customized home furnishing sector , attracted the attention of the entire home furnishing industry .
on the 9@@ th ( beijing time ) , reuters reported that samsung electronics co ltd launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and in@@ fo@@ tainment solutions it jointly developed with har@@ man international on tuesday . this was a major move by the company to expand into the automotive electronics market .
samsung electronics acquired har@@ man international about a year ago .
at the international consumer electronics show ( ces ) held in las vegas this week , samsung unveiled its automotive camera equipped with collision warning , lan@@ e@@ -@@ departure warning , and adaptive cruise control , which was also developed jointly with har@@ man .
samsung plans to begin shipping this camera system , which is built on automatic machine learning and augmented reality technology this year .
samsung also exhibited a “ digital cockpit ” , which allows a car to adapt to the personalized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by accessing the user ’ s information from mobile devices and cloud .

fire eng@@ ul@@ fs dubai 's ' torch ' skyscra@@ per for second time
a fire ripped through one of the world 's tallest residential towers in dubai on friday , forcing hundreds of occup@@ ants to flee the 3@@ 37 me@@ tre@@ -@@ tall , 7@@ 9@@ -@@ storey structure .
it 's the second blaze to sweep through the high@@ -@@ rise - which happens to be called the torch tower - in just two years .
the building was evacuated , no injuries were reported , and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze .
" we were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming .
we ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50@@ th floor , " a resident who gave his name as george told reuters .
dubai 's civil defence authorities said fire@@ fighting squ@@ ads put out the blaze at around 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 0@@ 000 g@@ mt ) and were cooling the building .
the government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected .
the incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exter@@ i@@ ors of tall buildings across the world .
an investigation by the management of the torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding , exterior pan@@ elling used for decoration or insulation .
in the uk , police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on london 's gren@@ fell tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in june in which some 80 people died .
the williams team also suggested that mass@@ a might return , even though he had already announced his retirement .
january 9 is just a month away from the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympics . as the olympic torch relay moves north , warm@@ -@@ ups and intense preparations for the games were carried out . south korea was warming up for the winter olympics .
public opinion in south korea hope that this long@@ -@@ waited north@@ -@@ south dialog would lead to an “ easter egg ” ( nice surprise ) for the countdown to the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympic games .
the winter olympic torch arrived in south korea on november 1 last year .
the fer@@ vor stirred up by the olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympics .
a little over two months ago , the proportion of tickets sold ling@@ ered at 32 % for the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympics , and a mere 4.3 % for the winter paralym@@ pics . the sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympics at one point .
however , just as the chairman of the p@@ yeong@@ chang organizing committee for the 2018 olympic & paralympic winter games , lee he@@ e@@ -@@ be@@ om predicted , “ as the winter olympic torch is carried and passed on across south korea , interest in the winter olympics will rise . i believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly ” .
south korean media reported that as of january 3 , the proportion of tickets sold for the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympics has reached 64 % , and that for the paralym@@ pics has also exceeded 50 % .
to encourage foreigners to come to watch the games , south korea ’ s ministry of justice has also announced on the 8@@ th that foreigners who visit the country for the p@@ yeong@@ chang winter olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days .
more than 1 in 5 us travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft , survey finds
a survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly smuggled prohibited items past the us transportation security administration check@@ points onto the aircraft , including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while un@@ intentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bl@@ aded objects .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered bel@@ atedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms , ammunition or explosives .
the survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet@@ -@@ char@@ tering service strat@@ os jet char@@ ters inc . - also found that younger travellers were more likely to fl@@ out the rules .
of the respondents who admitted know@@ ingly trying to fly with something banned by the ts@@ a , 19.@@ 7 per cent were mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of generation x .
the most common items whis@@ ked past ts@@ a agents on purpose were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent admitted know@@ ingly carrying bl@@ aded items past security , while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft .
the company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contra@@ band through airport security and how many had done so on purpose .
it 's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contra@@ band past security - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were those who fly the most .
as the company points out , however , the ts@@ a guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them .
so it 's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the ts@@ a happens to be forbidden liquids .
for a time , people thought the ts@@ a might be treating books as contra@@ band .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international ones .
epa chief pr@@ u@@ it@@ t back@@ tracks on delaying ob@@ ama@@ -@@ era rules to reduce emissions
one day after getting sued by 15 states , environmental protection agency chief scott pr@@ u@@ it@@ t reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of ob@@ ama@@ -@@ era rules reducing emissions of smo@@ g@@ -@@ causing air pollutants .
pr@@ u@@ it@@ t presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administra@@ tions to the needs of state environmental regulators .
he made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court .
at issue is an oc@@ t@@ . 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground@@ -@@ level ozone .
pr@@ u@@ it@@ t announced in june he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering with local decisions or impe@@ ding economic growth . "
pr@@ u@@ it@@ t , who was oklahoma 's state attorney general prior to his appointment by president donald trump , has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .
since arriving in washington , pr@@ u@@ it@@ t has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel industries .
wednesday 's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for pr@@ u@@ it@@ t 's regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal appeals court in washington ruled the epa administrator over@@ stepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .
in a statement issued wednesday evening , pr@@ u@@ it@@ t suggested his about@@ -@@ face on ozone standards simply reinforced the epa 's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time .
" under previous administra@@ tions , epa would often fail to meet designation dead@@ lines , and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others , agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation , " said pr@@ u@@ it@@ t , who sued epa more than a dozen times in his prior job .
" we do not believe in regulation through litigation , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously . "
still , the epa 's statement said pr@@ u@@ it@@ t may at some point once again use his " delay authority and all other authority legally available " to ensure regulations " are founded on sound policy and the best available information . "
republicans in congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules .
a house bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the senate .
new york attorney general eric sch@@ ne@@ id@@ er@@ man , who led the coalition of states that sued the epa this week , said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure .
" the epa 's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million new yor@@ kers , and the over 115 million americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities , " sch@@ ne@@ id@@ er@@ man said .
new york was joined in the case by california , connecticut , del@@ aware , illinois , iowa , maine , massachusetts , minnesota , new mexico , oregon , pennsylvania , rho@@ de island , vermont and washington , and the district of columbia .
ground@@ -@@ level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year .
public health advocates and environment@@ alists cheered pr@@ u@@ it@@ t 's surprising change of course .
" it 's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this common@@ sense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe , " said lori ann bur@@ d of the center for biological diversity .
" we 've got to keep fighting the trump administration 's ideological crus@@ ade to pan@@ der to pollu@@ ters and special interests . "

since the second half of 2009 , sales ( volume ) of xiaoshan ’ s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoy@@ ant . this spring in particular , sales of xiaoshan ’ s seedlings recorded a historic high . sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped . statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year , the sales revenue of seedlings in the xiaoshan district increased by 48 % year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year , and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years .
shi hai@@ yong , deputy director of the xiaoshan forestry bureau , said that the production of xiaoshan ’ s flowering trees and shrubs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend .
in the last two years , the planting ac@@ re@@ age of xiaoshan ’ s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu , with total area at 18@@ 0,000 mu . at the same time , expansion is being actively carried out outside the region . xiaoshan ’ s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country , an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008 .
while expanding planting ac@@ re@@ age , the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve ; the existing value of the nur@@ series has been rising . more large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved , and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings .
shi hai@@ yong also said that confronted with the current buoy@@ ant peak production and sales period , producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation , and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase . at the same time , they should also be aware that market competition will intensify .
july 13 morning beijing time . us@@ -@@ based som@@ al@@ tus filed a lawsuit in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of texas accusing apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010 .
the company had previously used the same patent to sue asus , lenovo , samsung , sony and toshiba .
the lawsuit claimed that iphone 6@@ s and apple equipment similar to it have violated us patent no. 7,@@ 65@@ 7,@@ 3@@ 86 , which is known as “ integrated battery service system ” .
the plaintiff is seeking monetary damages or roy@@ alties on the infringing equipment upon announcement of the verdict .
according to the indictment , the plaintiff appears to believe that iphone ’ s fast@@ -@@ charging technology j@@ as violated the former ’ s patent .
iphone ’ s fast@@ -@@ charging function charges the battery quickly until to 80 % of its capacity , then switches to slower trick@@ le charging .
som@@ al@@ tus is actually a so@@ -@@ called “ patent tro@@ ll ” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service , and it is hard to find any information on the company online .
however , it has successfully reached out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ court settlement with auto makers such as ford and nissan with this patent .
the meeting believed that accelerating information development ; promoting interconnection and integration , as well as efficient utilization of resources ; and enhancing the level of digi@@ tization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “ made in china 2025 ” ; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses ; developing new drivers ; and raising the standard of living for the masses .

moore 's ford massacre : activists re@@ en@@ act racist lyn@@ ching as a call for justice
a 1948 ford mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural monroe , georgia , and rum@@ bled toward the small moore 's ford bridge .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path .
the leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pin@@ striped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and pe@@ ered through the windshield .
inside , the occup@@ ants re@@ eled in fear .
" we want that n@@ --@@ --@@ r roger ! " the man bar@@ ked .
" get him out of the car ! "
screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat .
fortunately , this horri@@ fic scene , which played out on july 22 , is just a re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
but when a no@@ ose is thrown around the neck of " roger , " nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gas@@ ps .
since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to the moore 's ford bridge to recre@@ ate the night two black couples - roger and dorothy mal@@ com , and george and mae murray dor@@ sey - were lyn@@ ched by the ku k@@ lux k@@ lan in 1946 .
no one has ever been charged with the murders .
" it 's mind bo@@ ggling that all of these years , not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities ; even though we know who they are , " said tyr@@ one brooks , who helps organize the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment .
" it 's a stain on a history , but it 's a burden on our souls . "
brooks is a 7@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old former georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist .
for him , the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
" we want prosecution , we want closure , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but we have to have justice first , " he said .
" we can 't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . "
a coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the moore 's ford lyn@@ ching on july 27 , 1946 .
according to fbi files obtained by nbc news , more than 50 men from monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lyn@@ ching .
but not one was ever prosecuted .
though the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say the twin motiv@@ ations for the lyn@@ ch@@ ings were always well known throughout town : politics and sex .
in april 1946 , a supreme court ruling enabled black citizens in georgia to cast bal@@ lots for the first time during the primary race later that summer .
around the same time of the election , according to the fbi , black sha@@ rec@@ ro@@ pper roger mal@@ com stabbed bar@@ nett hes@@ ter , a white lan@@ dow@@ ner , during a fight - o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly over a woman .
brooks said the town rumor was that hes@@ ter had been sleeping with mal@@ com 's wife , dorothy , and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband 's .
on july 25 , 1946 , lo@@ y harrison , a prominent white lan@@ dow@@ ner , paid $ 600 to bail mal@@ com out of jail , according to the fbi .
he was accompanied to the prison by dorothy , and their cousins , mae murray and george dor@@ sey .
but , driving away from the jail , as they approached moore 's ford bridge , a lynch mob surrounded the car .
" as it turns out it was harrison who set up and ordered the murders , " one fbi report concludes .
" it is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement , who not only took part in the murders , disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses . "
brooks put it more succin@@ c@@ tly .
" it was a voting rights massacre , " he said .
" they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' if you register and if you vote , this is what will happen to you . ' "
for nearly a decade , cass@@ and@@ ra gre@@ ene has directed the annual re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment of the moore 's ford bridge lyn@@ ch@@ ings .
her performance is graphic , gri@@ pping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in america .
it 's difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but gre@@ ene said that 's the point .
" we don 't want to talk about the lyn@@ ching because it makes us face the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , " she said .
" but i can 't build a relationship with you , if you won 't hear me , or hear what i 've been through . "
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year 's production began in june , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as gre@@ ene launched into a well@@ -@@ rehear@@ sed overview of the play .
wade mar@@ bau@@ gh serves as gre@@ ene 's co@@ -@@ director .
he 's played the part of the head kl@@ ans@@ man for years , but he said the role never gets any easier .
" i feel dirty because this is not who i am , " said mar@@ bau@@ gh .
" but i think it 's very important to keep this history alive because we don 't want to go back to those times . "
across the room , actors dar@@ ri@@ us brad@@ shaw and nick ras@@ con@@ a , who play roger mal@@ com and bar@@ nett hes@@ ter , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the play begins with mal@@ com shouting and sho@@ ving hes@@ ter , li@@ vid that he 's been sleeping with his wife , dorothy .
" i said n@@ --@@ -@@ a , get off my property ! "
ras@@ con@@ a fires back .
there 's a beat .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) bursts into laughter .
gre@@ ene laughs the hardest .
" what ? ! , " ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he 's alarmed , confused .
did i go too hard ?
" no , " gre@@ ene said through chuc@@ kles .
" i just don 't think white people back then said ' n@@ --@@ -@@ a . ' "
" yea , " one of the other black cast members qui@@ pped .
" you have to hit the hard ' r@@ . ' "
and just like that the energy in the room shifts ; a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ad@@ erie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is dedicated to getting this right , not only for the sake of the play , but also for the memory of the four people killed .
the scene begins again .
this time , when ras@@ con@@ a says the n@@ -@@ word , it 's sharp and empha@@ tic .
absolutely no one laughs .
the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment ends violently and quickly .
there 's screams , gun@@ fire and then , silence .
a woman dressed in funeral black , stands over the actors bodies and performs bil@@ lie holiday 's mour@@ n@@ ful eu@@ logy , " strange fruit . "
her voice breaks on every other word .
a hundred yards back , a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes .
the audience is almost evenly split between black and white .
one couple has traveled from ith@@ aca , new york , to see the performance , many are from just down the road .
they 've all wea@@ thered georgia 's op@@ pressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the mal@@ com@@ s and dor@@ se@@ ys .
up until this point , the murders have remained an anec@@ dote , but now , standing on the same land where the lyn@@ ch@@ ings took place , the air feels haunted .
as the final notes of the song fade , gre@@ ene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies .
children cr@@ ouch by their heads , take in the fake blood and still bodies , and whisper to each other .
" they 're not really dead , " one little boy mut@@ ters , as if to remind himself .
after a few minutes gre@@ ene thanks the crowd , and suddenly it 's over .
the actors throw off the lyn@@ ching rope and wipe away tears .
brad@@ shaw hu@@ gs mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the head kl@@ ans@@ man .
nick ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his cast@@ mates , and then breaks down crying in their arms ; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him .
" it 's okay , " one of the women whis@@ pers .
" we know that 's not what 's in your heart .
you did this for a reason . "
later , the audience sits down to dinner with the actors .
at one table , a white couple from atlanta ch@@ ats ani@@ ma@@ tedly about the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment with a black couple they just met .
denise dupl@@ in@@ ski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel .
" it 's hard to hear those horrible awful words , and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .
" what this really does to me is make me think that lyn@@ ch@@ ings are still going on , " she added , " they 're just called police shoo@@ tings now . "
across the room , tyr@@ one brooks holds court at his table , eating and reminis@@ cing about civil rights .
he said he 's already begun planning for next year 's performance .
" the re@@ en@@ ac@@ tment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured , but it also is a teaching moment , " he said .
" it 's like , if you don 't learn from this , it can happen again .
those who don 't study their history , those who do not know their history , are doomed to repeat it . "
as regards implementing market@@ -@@ oriented reforms associated with natural gas , the importance of reform with respect to “ pipeline and grid independence ” is self@@ -@@ evident , but more resistance and controversy can be expected .
on the 7@@ th , reporters learned from kail@@ uan ( group ) that at 11 : 25 am on the 7@@ th , an explosion occurred at the emulsi@@ fying workshop of kail@@ uan ( group ) chemical co . , lt@@ d. which is located at gu@@ ye district of tangshan , hebei province ; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion .

us media : scientists from the air force engineering university of china looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris
reference news january 18 report us media claims that chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy earth orbit , and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris .
a january 15 report on us “ news@@ week ” website stated that researchers at the air force engineering university of china have written a thesis on “ research on de@@ -@@ orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space@@ -@@ based laser ” . this thesis described how by using space@@ -@@ based platform lasers , space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation .
the report claimed that for years , space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies . nasa has considered many alternative plans to track , probe and remove human made debris .
the methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris , as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit . chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion . this will be an effective method for cleaning up the earth ’ s orbit .
the abstract of the thesis claimed that “ ( the simulated study ) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space@@ -@@ based laser . ”
a 2014 research conducted by us defense industry giant lock@@ heed martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned , approximately 200 deter@@ rents exist daily .
the high@@ -@@ speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions , and have been described by european space agency experts as a “ series of fatal threats ” . high@@ -@@ speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years .
according to a january 17 report on the us@@ -@@ based “ popular mechanics ” website , space is basically empty , but space around earth has become increasingly crowded . every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting earth . as time passes , these debris will accumulate .
as debris increase , the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher , thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of us dollars .
the report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future .
nasa is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de@@ -@@ orbit . europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth . japan ’ s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris .
at this time , china has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem , and that is , to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller , less harmful pieces .
according to a thesis published in german magazine “ optics ” , a group of researchers at the air force engineering university of china claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space ; at least , according to the simulated results , that is .
the report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests . currently , there are no arrangements for such as mission , but sooner or later , someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space .
once this is achieved , we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good .

the epa announced the decision to go ahead with the so@@ -@@ called " 2015 ozone desig@@ nations " late on wednesday , saying it showed the agency 's commitment to working with states .
" we believe in dialogue with , and being responsive to , our state partners , " epa chief scott pr@@ u@@ it@@ t said in a statement .
pr@@ u@@ it@@ t in june had announced the epa 's intention to delay the ozone desig@@ nations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to october 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of columbia , filed a suit on tuesday saying the effort was illegal .
the administration of president donald trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former president barack obama , as part of a broader agenda trump says is aimed at spar@@ king economic growth .
but the efforts have triggered push@@ back by democra@@ tics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .

vas@@ yl lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and mi@@ key garcia , who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 14@@ 7 pounds in the near future , met each other for the first time thursday .
they were in separate rooms at es@@ pn offices in los angeles until garcia , the un@@ beaten world boxing council lightweight champion , walked down the hallway to greet lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the world boxing organization super@@ -@@ fea@@ ther@@ weight champion .
after garcia 's victory by unanimous decision over former four@@ -@@ division world champion adri@@ en br@@ oner on saturday on show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top@@ -@@ five p@@ ound@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ pound list .
garcia extended his right hand and said , " how you doing , champ ?

i want to come down to lightweight .

the position stated by national development and reform commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11@@ th five@@ -@@ year plan ahead of time gives the steel industry , which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas , strong expectations of resumption of production .
although steel plants , as of now , have yet to receive clear notification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended , the industry expects that by around december 15 , 2010 , steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production successively . steel prices could start to come under pressure .
a spokesperson from a private steel enterprise in hebei told our reporter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time , but in reality , pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in september and october .
some local governments in hebei province have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas , and have adopted mandatory power shutdown measures to limit production .
the reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in hebei have resumed production at this time , and pressure from production quotas have eased .
my@@ steel@@ .@@ com analyst zhang ties@@ han estimated that end@@ -@@ user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in northern china .
coupled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down , most steel plants will generally resume production by around december 15 . products will gradually make their way to markets across the country before new year ’ s day .
the increase in the supply of resources will exert some pressure on soaring steel prices .

new results of sweden 's asylum age assessment tests released
the latest results of tests on asylum seekers in sweden subjected to a new method of medic@@ ally assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18 , but not everyone has faith in their accuracy .
sweden 's national forensic medicine agency ( r@@ ä@@ tt@@ s@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started carrying out the tests earlier year .
they are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the swedish migration agency ( mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) was criticized for fail@@ ings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be under@@ age .
to date mig@@ ration@@ s@@ ver@@ ket has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested , and the forensic medicine agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period between mid march until july 3@@ 1@@ st , 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or over , while in a further 25 cases the forensic medicine agency judged that the subject was " possibly 18 or over . "
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 . "
the tests are only carried out in cases where the person 's age is in question .
according to jo@@ han g@@ ö@@ r@@ ans@@ son from the forensic medicine agency , the results are consistent with previous months .
" we see no big difference in the statistics from previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , " he told the local .
the high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age .
in may , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 instances that " suggest the person examined is 18 years or older . "
when newspaper s@@ ven@@ ska dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results released however it found that in 2@@ 43 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which consists of taking x@@ -@@ rays of wisdom teeth and mri scans of knee joints , then having denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists analyse them , has also been critic@@ ised in some quarters .
one scep@@ tic is kar@@ olin@@ ska institute endocr@@ in@@ ologist claude marcus , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual .
" i 've had reason to think about this , and i don 't think the type of measurement being used should be .
judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we can 't say it for sure we shouldn 't pretend that we can , " he told newspaper metro .
the forensic medicine agency 's g@@ ö@@ r@@ ans@@ son defended the accuracy of the tests however : " in general you can say that the risk of in@@ accurately judging a child to be an adult is small .
the biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in which case it 's around 10 percent . "
west virginia governor announces he 's switching parties
the democratic governor of west virginia , jim justice , announced thursday night at a rally with president trump that he 's switching parties .

the rally erupted in cheers .
" so tomorrow , i will be changing my registration to republican , " justice added .
" as a coach , i would tell you it 's time to run another play . "

mr. trump won west virginia by 42 points , and justice did not endorse the democratic nominee , hillary clinton .

forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states , having inherited a coal business from his father .
he 's worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , the republican national committee released a statement thursday night saying " governor justice 's party switch is another blow to a democratic party that would rather obstruc@@ t than work to make our country great again . "
" with only 15 govern@@ or@@ ships and control of the fe@@ west state legisl@@ atures in history , governor justice 's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is lead@@ er@@ less from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , " r@@ nc chair@@ woman ron@@ na mc@@ daniel said in a statement to cbs news .

coe praises ' can@@ did ' russian apology for doping scandal
global athletics boss sebastian coe praised what he described as a can@@ did apology from russia over a doping scandal on thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be read@@ mitted to the sport .
russia 's athletics boss dmit@@ ry shy@@ la@@ kh@@ tin told an ia@@ af congress , held on the eve of the world athletics championships , that his country 's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .
he said he was sorry to " all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions . "
despite his comments , the ia@@ af congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban , imposed in november 2015 after a world anti@@ -@@ doping agency ( w@@ ada ) report found evidence of state@@ -@@ sponsored doping in russia .
" i thought it was a very can@@ did response today , a very can@@ did presentation , " ia@@ af president coe told reporters .
" the whole council and the whole congress was pleased ... that the russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty tor@@ rid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is re@@ engineered . "
coe said he was also " pleased " that russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
" i think it was a very constructive day and i think progress is being made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to rein@@ state russia , " said coe .
" we need to do everything over the next few months to normal@@ ize this situation .
the guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system , " he added
nineteen russian athletes will be competing as neutr@@ als at the world athletics championships which start in london on friday , having met strict ia@@ af criteria .

the bei@@ ge book published by federal reserve shows that almost all 12 fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 . the federal reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year .
meanwhile , the u.s. unemployment rate remained at 4.1 % in december , the lowest since 2000 , and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months .
fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook . the fed predicts that the economy will increase by 2.5 % in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times .
some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ecb ’ s monetary policy pushes up the exchange rate of the euro in recent days . as a result , the us dollar index declines continuously , and the rmb exchange rate against the us dollar has seen a surge in prices . however , the european central bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon . after the short@@ -@@ term fluctuation of the foreign exchange market , the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dic@@ tated by the fundamentals , and the continued smooth operation of the rmb exchange rate is a high probability event .
it is worth noting that , as the market expects a more stable renminbi , the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase .

how soccer 's financial rules impact ne@@ y@@ mar 's move to paris
rules aimed at preventing un@@ fet@@ tered spending by european soccer clubs will not disrupt ne@@ y@@ mar 's world@@ -@@ record transfer from spain 's barcelona to france 's par@@ is@@ -@@ saint ger@@ main .
any consequences will come further down the line for paris sa@@ int@@ -@@ ger@@ main from u@@ ef@@ a , the governing body over@@ seeing the european game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious champions league tournament .
financial fair play rules launched by u@@ ef@@ a in 2011 mean that ps@@ g will eventually have to show that ne@@ y@@ mar 's transfer was funded without incur@@ ring huge losses .
barcelona has been paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) just to buy the brazilian out of his contract and ne@@ y@@ mar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of ne@@ y@@ mar 's move to france .
ps@@ g can certainly st@@ ump up the cash to sign ne@@ y@@ mar and add him to a galaxy of other stars , given the team 's funding from the ener@@ gy@@ -@@ rich ruling family of qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counter@@ balance that with legitimate sources of income , allowing them to approach break@@ -@@ even on their football@@ -@@ related business .
ff@@ p was conceived by mi@@ chel plat@@ ini after his election as u@@ ef@@ a president in 2007 .
the former france player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support .
in 2011 , ff@@ p shifted from focusing on clubs ' debts to monitoring their losses instead .
the change meant that the business model roman abra@@ mo@@ v@@ ich initially used at chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential , and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition .
during the current three@@ -@@ year ff@@ p assessment period that runs through 2018 , clubs can incu@@ r losses of 30 million euros .
and despite plat@@ ini being ous@@ ted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015 , his u@@ ef@@ a successor al@@ ek@@ san@@ der ce@@ fer@@ in is still committed to deter@@ ring excessive spending .
" certainly ff@@ p is not dead and we will , for sure , reinforce the rules going forward , " andrea tra@@ ver@@ so , who over@@ sees ff@@ p at u@@ ef@@ a , told the associated press last week .
although ps@@ g will have paid ne@@ y@@ mar 's buy@@ out clause in one lump sum , it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract .
ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a five@@ -@@ year deal , so the transfer fee could be shown as a 4@@ 4.4 mil@@ lion@@ -@@ euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years .
the first wave of ff@@ p sanctions in 2014 saw ps@@ g , along with abu dha@@ bi@@ -@@ owned manchester city , hit with the hea@@ vi@@ est sanctions .
ps@@ g was handed a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its champions league squ@@ ads to 21 players for the 201@@ 4@@ -@@ 15 season instead of the normal 25 .
u@@ ef@@ a is on the look@@ out for clubs who might try to outw@@ it its financial regulators by infl@@ ating their income through companies linked to a club 's owners .
while a q@@ at@@ ari company could sponsor ps@@ g , if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates u@@ ef@@ a would not allow it to count as legitimate income .
that is what happened in 2014 when u@@ ef@@ a ruled that the value of the qatar tourism authority sponsorship of ps@@ g was inflated .
it has been reported that part of ne@@ y@@ mar 's ps@@ g earnings could come via payments from the 2022 world cup organizing committee in qatar .
but ps@@ g and qatar 2022 have denied that ne@@ y@@ mar will become a world cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for u@@ ef@@ a 's regulators to expose .
past sanctions slapped on ps@@ g means that u@@ ef@@ a will be even more watch@@ ful of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
u@@ ef@@ a has not been in pre@@ -@@ emptive discussions with ps@@ g about ne@@ y@@ mar 's transfer , people familiar with the situation said thursday .
they spoke to the associated press on condition of anonym@@ ity as they were not authorized to discuss the ps@@ g situation .
the last published accounts show that ps@@ g made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 201@@ 5@@ -@@ 16 on a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published .
ps@@ g expects ne@@ y@@ mar 's arrival to be a bo@@ on for sponsorship deals , merchandis@@ ing and jersey sales .
the club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing .
clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of soccer 's biggest players leaving , the spanish league tried to sty@@ mie ne@@ y@@ mar 's move , claiming that ps@@ g will be bre@@ aching ff@@ p .
" it is a clear case of ' financial doping ' , with the club and the state , " la lig@@ a president ja@@ vier te@@ bas told spanish newspaper as , referring to qatar 's ultimate ownership of ps@@ g .
arsenal manager arsen@@ e w@@ enger , whose club is owned by an american sports tycoon , shares la lig@@ a 's reservations about a state funding a club .
" it is the consequence of the ow@@ ner@@ ships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " w@@ enger said thursday .
" once a country owns a club , everything is possible .
it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country . "

“ tofu ” is based on a traditional all@@ usion concerning liu an , prince of huainan in the han dynasty - “ liu an made a mistake and invented tofu ” . it is an account of “ dou fu ” , the leading character , a bean who mir@@ acul@@ ously took on human form , how he over@@ came numerous difficulties and per@@ severed in his dream to become an immortal . this adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with hubei ’ s local culture .

nostalgia goes niche in " wet hot american summer " and " comrade detective "
so this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalg@@ ic for the characters ' ' 80@@ s glory days ; for the ' 90@@ s grun@@ ge era ( around when the master@@ minds david wain and michael sho@@ walter made the sketch comedy " the state " for m@@ tv ) ; and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before its stars , like elizabeth banks , amy poe@@ h@@ ler and paul rud@@ d , went on to bigger things .
as a cultural artifact , it 's both a sen@@ dup and embodiment of our face@@ book@@ -@@ enabled era of permanent reminis@@ cence .
but as a franchise , it feels like it 's running out of time .
" first day of camp " worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absur@@ dist humor ( it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables , voiced by h@@ . jon benjamin ) .
by doubling down on the core ga@@ g - middle@@ -@@ age actors playing hor@@ ny kids coming of age - it made the im@@ possibility of recap@@ turing the past part of the joke .
" ten years later , " with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and its par@@ ody more scat@@ ter@@ shot , including a ri@@ ff on ' 90@@ s stal@@ ker flic@@ ks like " the hand that rocks the cradle . "
at one point a character rum@@ mag@@ es through an apple power@@ book , some in@@ -@@ line sk@@ ates and " a bunch of other things from 1991 . "
many of the core stories are the same .
swee@@ t@@ -@@ hearted coo@@ p ( mr. sho@@ walter ) , now a novelist , still hasn 't gotten over katie ( mar@@ guer@@ ite mo@@ rea@@ u ) .
victor ( ken mar@@ ino ) still hasn 't lost his virgin@@ ity .
and there 's another bat@@ tily villa@@ inous plot involving ronald reagan ( also mr. sho@@ walter ) , now ab@@ et@@ ted by george h@@ . w@@ . bush ( a well@@ -@@ inhabited impression by michael ian black ) .
as always , the best part of the franchise is the dig@@ res@@ sions .
it 's especially fun to see the fore@@ ver@@ -@@ young mr. rud@@ d , sporting matt d@@ ill@@ on 's soul patch from " singles , " whose former big@@ -@@ man@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ camp andy now feels like a gee@@ zer .
it 's the moments of random lun@@ acy that might power this franchise on , like a kind of recursive " seven up ! " series , until it reaches what i assume will be its logical conclusion : " wet hot american summer : twenty years later , " whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of " wet hot american summer . "
" comrade detective " on amazon , meanwhile , appeals to a different brand of nostalgia : the cold war revi@@ val@@ ism of " the americans , " the film " atomic blonde " and even " glow , " with its east versus west wrestling icon@@ ography .
the comedy , created by brian gate@@ wood and al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro tanaka , with rh@@ ys thomas directing , pur@@ ports to be found tv : a roman@@ ian 198@@ 0@@ s bud@@ dy@@ -@@ cop drama about two bu@@ ch@@ arest officers fighting for truth , athe@@ ism and the mar@@ xi@@ st@@ -@@ len@@ in@@ ist way .
the lead roles - hard@@ -@@ boiled greg@@ or and ide@@ alistic io@@ se@@ f - are played by flor@@ in pier@@ sic j@@ r@@ . and corn@@ eli@@ u ul@@ ic@@ i , their dialogue dubbed in english by chan@@ ning tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and joseph gor@@ don@@ -@@ le@@ vit@@ t .
it 's a brilliant idea .
but it 's not much more than an idea .
there are some fine sight g@@ ag@@ s ( the police pass the time watching chess on tv as americans might football ) .
and the ro@@ ster of famous vo@@ ice@@ -@@ over actors - among them jenny slate , nick off@@ er@@ man , ma@@ her@@ sh@@ ala ali and chlo@@ ë se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes for a decent game of spot@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ voice .
but " comrade detective " is so committed to the ver@@ is@@ im@@ il@@ itude of a ham@@ f@@ isted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one .
at six long episodes , it dra@@ gs , and the comedy isn 't fast or frequent enough .
edited to a tighter length , " comrade detective " might deliver better on its ag@@ it@@ prop sa@@ tire , as when greg@@ or and io@@ se@@ f repeatedly visit the american embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wol@@ fing down a pile of hamburgers .
the message , for the imagined communist audience , is that western culture can turn anything into fo@@ d@@ der to bing@@ e .
the fictional roman@@ ian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history , and theirs .
reporters learned from recent interviews that the performance of the steel , rail transport , shipping vessel , machinery manufacture and other industries has fallen in general ; some have even incurred losses .
some experts believed that under the present circumstances , a new round of revitalization of the industries in northeast china will not only concern the nation ’ s current economic recovery , it will also have an impact on the long@@ -@@ term growth and international competitiveness of china 's manufacturing sector . hence , there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place .
traditional industries saw a general decline in performance , and even incurred losses . the raw material industry , and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly , and even incurred losses . these were the first signs from the industries in northeast china amid the current sluggish economy .
when the economy deceler@@ ated in the past , low@@ -@@ end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected . in the current economic fluctuation however , both high@@ - and low@@ -@@ end industrial products of northeast china ’ s traditional industries were affected .
a few years ago , an@@ steel group ( weibo ) began by adjusting its product mix , and gave priority to developing high@@ -@@ end steel plates such as those for containers , railroad tracks , shipbuilding , and civilian home appliances . however , sales of these product categories fell significantly . in particular , the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50 % year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year .

yang yang , who underwent surgery on his right ear just a few days ago , made an appearance for the first time after his recuper@@ ation . he interpreted his character as someone who “ does not wear his heart on his sleeve ” , quietly giving his all to bai qian , and conce@@ aling all his feelings .
yang yang said that he had to rou@@ se all his emotions to convey the character ’ s hidden sadness to the audience . “ this was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor . while acting this character , i was so emotionally suppressed that i almost suffered internal injury ” .
liu yi@@ fei , meanwhile , revealed that while acting her character in the movie , she cried so much that she collapsed at one point .

bank of england to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the bank of england is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after l@@ ack@@ lu@@ stre economic growth and easing inflation dam@@ pened speculation over a hike .
the bank of england has warned economic growth will remain " sluggish " as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes .
policymakers on the bank 's monetary policy committee ( m@@ pc ) voted 6@@ -@@ 2 to keep rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members this month calling for a rise as l@@ ack@@ lu@@ stre economic growth has weakened support for a hike .
in its quarterly inflation report , the bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and cau@@ tioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue , with inflation still expected to surge close to 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alled rate hi@@ kes will be needed over the next few years to rein in bre@@ x@@ it@@ -@@ fu@@ elled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the mam@@ moth econom@@ y@@ -@@ boosting package unle@@ ashed a year ago in the aftermath of brexit .
it will call time on the term funding scheme to offer che@@ ap@@ -@@ finance to banks from next february , although it said it was now expected to offer £ 15 billion more under the scheme - at £ 115 billion .
in minutes of the rates decision , the bank said : " in the m@@ pc 's central forecast , gross domestic product ( gdp ) remains sluggish in the near@@ -@@ term as the squeeze on households ' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption . "
on rates , it reiterated that " some tightening of monetary policy " would be needed to cool inflation and by a " somewhat greater " extent than markets expect .
markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
but the bank stressed that any hi@@ kes would be " gradual " and " limited . "
the bank 's down@@ graded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in may .
it maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8 % in 2018 .
sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news .
the pound was 0.5 % down at 1.@@ 31 us dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the no@@ -@@ change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dam@@ pened mounting expectations of a hike , with gdp ed@@ ging up to 0.3 % in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year , according to the bank .
its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and pal@@ try pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better .
it added that monetary policy " cannot prevent " the hit to incomes over the next few years , but expects wages will recover " significantly " towards the end of its three@@ -@@ year forecast .
the economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for british goods thanks to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumer spending .
the decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.@@ 25 % last august following the shock eu referendum vote , which sent the pound slum@@ ping .
the bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy .
prior to the bank 's latest rates verdict , there had been growing clam@@ our for a rate rise as inflation ram@@ ped up pressure on hard@@ -@@ pressed households , with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in july .
inflation eased back to 2.6 % last month from 2.9 % in june , although the bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months .
the bank said the over@@ shoot relative to its 2 % target was " entirely " down to the weak pound .
andrew mont@@ lake , director at co@@ rec@@ o mortgage brokers , said : " given the recent fall in swap rates , the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clam@@ our for business and look to end the year in positive fashion .
the market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re@@ -@@ mortgages , many with fee@@ -@@ free options as well as low rates , become ever more popular . "

n@@ hs to prescribe controversial hiv drug to 10,000
patients will be able to access a ' transforma@@ tive ' hiv prevention treatment from september following a high court battle over funding the drug on the n@@ hs .
n@@ hs england announced that pre@@ -@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ lax@@ is ( prep ) , a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high@@ -@@ risk individuals by around 86 per cent , will now be provided by the health service through an initial three@@ -@@ year trial to an estimated 10,000 people .
it agreed to fund the trial after the court of appeal uph@@ eld a high court ruling last year , which said the n@@ hs had the power to pay for prep despite its claims that local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on thursday was hailed as a ' major new intervention ' by n@@ hs england chief executive simon stevens while the national aids trust ( n@@ at ) described it as a ' pivotal moment ' .
sexual health clinics in london , brigh@@ ton , manchester , liverpool and sh@@ eff@@ i@@ eld will be among the first to start en@@ rolling people , with more clinics joining in october before full implementation across england by april 2018 .
pre@@ -@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ lax@@ is ( prep ) is a course of hiv drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting hiv .
trials have shown prep significantly reduces hiv transmission among those at@@ -@@ risk of infection .
taking prep before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person 's body to prevent an hiv infection taking hold .
such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex .
those eligible for the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ gender people and those with hi@@ v@@ -@@ positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment .
clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people , and individuals who have a partner whose hiv status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ -@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living and registered with a gp in england will also be able to en@@ rol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic .
the programme will cost £ 10 million and n@@ hs england signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the trial is designed to assess the full potential of prep by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted , taken up , and implemented on a large scale .
mr stevens said : ' this major new intervention should complement and super@@ charge the wide@@ -@@ ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent hiv .
it 's another milestone in more than three decades ' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity 's major health challenges . '
de@@ bor@@ ah gold , chief executive at n@@ at ( national aids trust ) , said : ' this is a pivotal moment in the fight against hiv .
prep , if targeted properly at those in need and at risk , offers the possibility of transforming the english hiv epidemic .
from september , people at high risk of hiv will have access via this n@@ hs@@ -@@ funded trial in england to an em@@ powering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . '
ian green , chief executive of the ter@@ rence hi@@ gg@@ ins trust , said : ' the priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speed@@ ily across the country , and that no@@ -@@ one at risk of hiv is left behind .
now that the prep trial drug has been procu@@ red , we 're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of hiv . '
shadow public health minister sharon hodg@@ son said : ' the start of the prep trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and he@@ el@@ -@@ dragging by the government .
the evidence shows just how transforma@@ tive this drug can be as part of our approach to hiv prevention and ending the transmission of this life@@ -@@ changing infection .
this trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of prep .
now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to hiv and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of hiv in society . '

living the high life : me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small ear@@ ls court flat into a spacious home
jo@@ anne leigh , a former banker with a passion for doing up property , down@@ sized from a large home in kni@@ ght@@ s@@ bridge to an ear@@ ls court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of a smart queen anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that jo@@ anne hasn 't packed her bags and sold on .
" before this , i was living with my ex in kni@@ ght@@ s@@ bridge in a much bigger space , " jo@@ anne says .
" i was looking for something that was comparable for my price .
i was shown this apartment in ear@@ ls court and it had the same high ce@@ il@@ ings .
i fell in love with it and put an offer in that day . "
since the first viewing , the 1,@@ 000@@ s@@ q ft flat has had a complete overhaul .
originally a one@@ -@@ bedroom property with a con@@ volu@@ ted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine to make the most of the generous ceiling height .
" i wanted high ce@@ il@@ ings , big windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , " she says .
to this end , she employed er@@ fan az@@ adi of no@@ tting hill@@ -@@ based architecture and design studio duck & shed to exploit the 12.@@ 5@@ ft ce@@ il@@ ings and create a home that wasn 't only a development but a place for jo@@ anne to live .
the ceiling wasn 't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine that you could stand up in .
er@@ fan had to think crea@@ tively to resolve the brief .
" the steel@@ work is quite complicated , " he explains .
" we had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hun@@ ch down .
it wasn 't just building a simple platform , but cran@@ king the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below . "
this arrangement allowed er@@ fan to get two full@@ -@@ height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ an@@ ine , a vintage copper light window from re@@ trou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glamorous living area below .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge mou@@ ille lighting all set the style for the scheme .
the use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red at both ends to make it appear longer .
in the kitchen , the mir@@ ro@@ red spl@@ ash@@ back feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units provide storage for all jo@@ anne 's cut@@ l@@ ery and glass@@ ware .
giving the perception of a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it 's not in use .
fol@@ da@@ way kit@@ chens are nothing new .
what 's unique about this one is that it 's a gar@@ age@@ -@@ style li@@ ft@@ -@@ up door .
" a bit of engineering went into that , " explains er@@ fan of the steel@@ -@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered m@@ df door .
" it 's counter@@ -@@ weighted so that when you push the door up , it gli@@ des really easily . "
thanks to clever use of space and storage , jo@@ anne gained an additional 16@@ s@@ q m , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
" at the end of the day , floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued , " er@@ fan says .
" in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size . "
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge .
" the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says er@@ fan .
" you don 't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls .
these are important but they don 't pull the heart strings . "
it goes to show that through good design and increased square me@@ tre@@ age , a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like jo@@ anne , you may choose not to leave .
about a year ago , this facebook ceo indicated that he wanted to develop an ai system , and has made it his annual personal challenge .

brothers fight over $ 500 million property empire
two brothers are at war over one of victoria 's biggest real estate em@@ pires , worth more than $ 500 million , four decades after their italian family founded the dynasty .
former carl@@ ton football club director and developer colin de lu@@ tis lives in a to@@ or@@ ak mansion three doors from younger brother paul , who has taken him to the supreme court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up .
paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an ac@@ ri@@ mon@@ ious argument is playing out in the supreme court over the break@@ -@@ up .
together with their mother anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , am@@ assed since the family bought a smith street , coll@@ ing@@ wood , shop in 1973 .
there , the family founded west@@ co jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
that money was sunk into property and the de lu@@ tis portfolio now includes city offices , brun@@ sw@@ ick and sor@@ ren@@ to development sites , gold coast and mt bull@@ er apartments , and suburban shopping centres .
under an agreement with their late father , colin - described by paul as " the major driving force and the dominant personality " in the de lu@@ tis family - owns about two@@ -@@ thirds of the company assets and paul about one@@ -@@ third .
a court filing says this trans@@ lates to colin owning property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and paul $ 17@@ 6 million .
dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for paul .
" the spl@@ its proposed by colin left him with what i considered to be the best properties , " he wrote in an initial court aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 .
last friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first supreme court hearing was held .
the brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which paul al@@ leges colin has locked him out of .
colin argues this is not true , but ac@@ cuses paul of in@@ compe@@ tently managing some properties .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it filed by colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .
" my italian heritage dic@@ tates that family is the most important priority , " he wrote .
costs are mounting in the case , with hundreds of pages of aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports by companies including del@@ o@@ it@@ te , pitcher partners and charter k@@ ec@@ k cra@@ mer filed and top barri@@ sters including all@@ an my@@ ers , q@@ c , and senior solic@@ itors retained by both sides .
ms de lu@@ tis and her late husband lu@@ ig@@ i were italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delic@@ ate@@ s@@ sen@@ s from the late 19@@ 50@@ s and in the early 197@@ 0@@ s bought a shop in brun@@ sw@@ ick .
they used the collateral to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood property where colin opened the family 's first jeans store .
colin says he started west@@ co there when he was " in my final years of high school , when paul was a young child ( around 10 years old ) . "
anna de lu@@ tis says she and lu@@ ig@@ i , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass down their properties to their sons am@@ ic@@ ably .
" lu@@ ig@@ i often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court , " she wrote .
two other brothers , mark and luke , are no longer part of the de lu@@ tis group of companies , with colin saying that mark was paid $ 10 million when he left the business , and luke $ 26 million .
both luke and mark had become , paul says , " bitter about the terms of their financial separation . "
colin has kept a low profile despite being a former af@@ l club board member and , according to a 2015 biography of eddie mc@@ gu@@ ire , the television star 's best friend .
fair@@ fax media contacted colin and paul de lu@@ tis on friday , and their lawyers .
only colin replied , by text message , to say that because the case was before the courts " i really cannot say much . "
" it 's very , very sad that my brother paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts , " he wrote .
in mid@@ -@@ 2016 , colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother 's requests .
" our father would not have wanted to see paul and i end up in our current dispute , " he said , adding that he was " still hopeful of resolution . "
on friday , that hope appeared gone .
" our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " colin wrote .

trump 's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president 's media diet .
others have tried and failed .
maybe john f@@ . kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
poli@@ tico reports that the new white house chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to president trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even ke@@ el .
here 's a bit from reporter josh daw@@ sey :
" when new white house chief of staff john f@@ . kelly hud@@ dled with senior staff on his first day at work , he outlined a key problem in president donald trump 's white house that he planned to fix : bad information getting into the president 's hands .
kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information . "
kelly 's diagnosis makes perfect sense , but others have tried and failed to tame trump by monitoring his media diet .
president trump 's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he 's in the white house , his tv@@ -@@ watching habit is still going strong .
" if candidate trump was upset about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persu@@ ad@@ able , " sam nun@@ berg , a former campaign adviser , told poli@@ tico in february .
poli@@ tico 's tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that " the key to keeping trump 's twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise . "
okay .
but the idea that trump 's twitter habit has ever been " under control " is lau@@ gha@@ ble .
maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don 't - that trump 's twee@@ ts would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions .
we 'll probably never know about twee@@ ts that trump didn 't send .
if his sta@@ ff@@ ers managed to him out of trouble even a few times , then their efforts were worthwhile .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent trump from stirring up controversy .
part of the problem is that in a white house composed of competing factions , people invari@@ ably try to advance their ag@@ end@@ as by presenting trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their world@@ views .
poli@@ tico - all over this story - reported in may on advisers ' pen@@ ch@@ ants for strategically feeding du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president .
this was one example , described by reporter shane gold@@ ma@@ cher :
" current and former trump officials say trump can react volcan@@ ically to negative press clips , especially those with damaging leaks , becoming eng@@ ros@@ sed in finding out where they originated .
that is what happened in late february when someone mis@@ ch@@ iev@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from got@@ news@@ .@@ com , the website of internet provo@@ cate@@ ur charles c@@ . johnson , which accused deputy chief of staff katie walsh of being ' the source behind a bunch of leaks ' in the white house .
no matter that johnson had been permanently banned from twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lo@@ bbed false accusations in the past and rec@@ an@@ ted them .
trump read the article and began asking staff about walsh . "
gold@@ ma@@ cher added that then@@ -@@ chief of staff re@@ ince pri@@ e@@ bus and white house staff secretary rob porter " have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork trump receives . "
how 'd that work out ?
kelly is trying to do the same thing , three months later .
perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than pri@@ e@@ bus , but trump is still his impulsive self , and his a@@ ides are still v@@ ying for influence .
those immu@@ table factors will make kelly 's mission very difficult .
tourism charm town : how does charm mes@@ mer@@ ize tourists
[ abstract ] the potential of small towns in zhejiang is gradually unle@@ ashed .
today , these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery , sav@@ or zhejiang culture , and feel nostalg@@ ic about zhejiang . they will also become key drivers to help the province create “ picturesque zhejiang ” , china ’ s most beautiful tourist destination .
repu@@ ted for local custom
" village theat@@ rical performance is staged as the moon rises , while the pleasant smell of delicious sausage spreads with breeze . "
walking through the an@@ chang ancient town in shaoxing , you can see hoop buc@@ kets , bamboo knitting , iron@@ making , shoes stitching , lace making , cotton spinning and other traditional handicraft techniques almost everywhere , which fully represent the intangible cultural heritage of the an@@ chang ancient town . tourists all over the world are enchan@@ ted to experience the folk customs and feel the atmosphere of shaoxing 's historical and cultural experience .
it is reported that during the three@@ -@@ day new year 's holiday , more than 6@@ 5,000 tourists visit an@@ chang ancient town .
in zhejiang , a town with a unique style such as an@@ chang ancient town is scattered all over like stars . the glit@@ tering waves of jiaxing x@@ itang is flowing with the warmth and gra@@ te@@ fulness of the lower reaches of the yang@@ ze river in the south ; the white walls of quzhou 's nian@@ bad@@ u ancient town convey to us the changes over time in the town ; and the mur@@ als of fishermen in sh@@ itang , taizhou draw a picture of their life , both traditional and modern . these towns are the " palm treasure " of zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions .
in recent years , with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region , the potential of zhejiang ’ s small towns have been gradually awakened .
in 2016 , the provincial government office issued the " the implementation of the creation of a tourist town in zhejiang province ” , which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs , beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so .
today , these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery , sav@@ or zhejiang culture , and feel nostalg@@ ic about zhejiang . they will also become key drivers to help the province create “ picturesque zhejiang ” , china ’ s most beautiful tourist destination .
the responsible people of the provincial tourism bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns , we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another . these have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing repu@@ tations .
emphasis on promotion
recently , directed by the zhejiang provincial tourism bureau and zhejiang daily press group , the tourism full media center of the zhejiang daily press group hosted the “ towns × future artists " sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of zhejiang style tourism towns , " poetic zhejiang , towns with folk customs ” . the closing ceremony took place in the zhejiang exhibition hall .
“ a style town has artistic beauty and living warmth .
the style of the towns lies in the original sense , flavor and township , which represents the original purity .
xie han@@ feng , a teacher at the school of film and television animation arts of china ’ s academy of art , the domestic a@@ -@@ list film and television advertising director , and professor xu xian@@ ghong , the dean of the school of art and communication at china j@@ iliang university , talked about the cross@@ -@@ border stories of towns through towns in the lens and reconstruction of small village .
many scenic tourist towns in zhejiang have deep cultural resources . dong xinjian , a town deputy from nan@@ xun , huzhou , appeared in the site in person and interpreted nan@@ xun as a traditional chinese painting .
the style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the yang@@ ze river have been popular with painters since ancient times . nowadays , the nan@@ xun ancient town is developing in@@ -@@ depth cooperation with art academ@@ ies such as the china academy of art .
tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style , tourism , service and the environment .
among these , tourism service facilities and the environment are very important .
if the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day , they can better experience the town ’ s style .
in the era of sharing , the tourism full media center of the zhejiang daily press group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “ poetic zhejiang ” style , hoping to promote the concept of “ sharing and green ” , spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents , and create a shared , beautiful tourist environment .
this has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of zhejiang ’ s tourism towns , " poetic zhejiang , towns with folk customs ” .
expecting wonders
up to now , zhejiang province has released the list of the first 21 provin@@ ci@@ al@@ -@@ level tourism towns that will ultimately cul@@ min@@ ate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns .
as the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “ 13@@ th five@@ -@@ year plan ” period , the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3@@ a or higher , becoming a new model for tourism product diversity , tourism benefits and industrial integration .
what makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality .
the beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the mi@@ sty bridges and rivers , but also from a long history of cultural tradition ; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self@@ -@@ confidence .
throughout the world , the tu@@ lips of the netherlands ’ lis@@ se town , the salt of austria ’ s hall@@ stat@@ t town , and the pump@@ kins of pumpkin town in france , have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year . this has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of sm@@ alls towns as well .
for the style towns , the point “ emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia ” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul , further providing cultural perme@@ ation , carrying local cultural traditions , and highlighting native civilizations .
tourism style towns , with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier , connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co@@ -@@ construction and sharing process .
essentially speaking , the tourism style town is a complex open@@ -@@ style tourism area , and it should be a shared living space for local residents , exotic tourists and even so@@ jour@@ ners .
as the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future , tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape , economic and social development patterns , and the flow direction of industrial factors . additionally , they will play an important role in eliminating the urban@@ -@@ rural infrastructure gap , hast@@ ening rural cultural recovery .
in the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside , zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story .
figures indicate that 70 % of china ’ s travel demand is concentrated within a 3@@ km radius . on this basis , the short@@ -@@ distance travel market will become a bike sharing paradise sooner or later .
a report in “ the nikkei ” claimed that inf@@ lationary pressure will increase because of the expan@@ sion@@ ary fiscal policies of the next trump administration . the pace of interest rate hi@@ kes will also accelerate in 2017 .
the annual international consumer electronics show ( ces ) , held between january 9 ( january 10 , beijing time ) and 12 , opened in las vegas , usa .
according to the list of exhibitors published by the official ces website , the 5@@ 1@@ st ces attracted 4,@@ 5@@ 77 corporate participants from around the world .
compared to the massive 13,000 tv dramas broadcast by satellite tv each year , these “ terminated dramas ” are but a drop in the ocean .

one anonymous resident said : ' they moved there on monday night after being moved on from bentley he@@ ath where they were throwing rocks at passers by .
the council needs to be sh@@ amed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in may , were moved on and now they are back again .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . '
she added : ' birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long in@@ junc@@ tions to protect their parks .
i live on street@@ s@@ brook road and i 'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can 't even stop this . '
one local resident who did not wish to be named said : ' it is ridiculous , we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving , only to be b@@ lighted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the park@@ land . '
a spokeswoman for sol@@ i@@ hull council said : ' we are aware of an un@@ author@@ ised enc@@ am@@ pment on land off street@@ s@@ brook road and working alongside sol@@ i@@ hull police , we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible .
to support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti@@ -@@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
this helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them . '

italy tough@@ ens tone on n@@ go migrant rescue boats
italy has warned ngos operating migrant rescue boats in the mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations .
" if ngos do not sign up to a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue operating , " interior minister marco min@@ nit@@ i said in an interview with tur@@ in daily la stam@@ pa .
min@@ nit@@ i 's warning came a day after italian authorities imp@@ ounded a boat operated by german aid organis@@ ati@@ ion ju@@ gen@@ d ret@@ tet on suspicion its crew effectively collabor@@ ated with people traff@@ ickers in a way that facil@@ itated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been operational for a year , declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by italian prosecutor am@@ bro@@ gio carto@@ sio .
" for us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority , so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " the organisation said in a statement on social media .
" we can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation . "
italian authorities had been monitoring ju@@ gen@@ d ret@@ tet 's boat , the i@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since october .
its crew is suspected to taking on board din@@ gh@@ y loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traff@@ ickers and allowing the smugg@@ lers to make off with the vessels to be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the libyan coast , according to the prosecutor 's file , the contents of which were published by italian media .
the crew are suspected of having fl@@ ou@@ ted the authority of the italian coast@@ guard , which over@@ sees rescue operations in the zone , out of humanitarian ze@@ al rather than for any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the i@@ u@@ vent@@ a would notably have to have an italian police officer on board monitoring their activities .
only three of the nine ngos involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : save the children , mal@@ ta@@ -@@ based mo@@ as and spain 's pro@@ -@@ acti@@ va open arms .
the latter said on thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any " significant change or impe@@ diment " to its rescue operations .
among those who have refused to sign is the nobel pri@@ ze@@ -@@ winning organisation doctors without borders ( ms@@ f ) .
min@@ nit@@ i meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in italy following rescu@@ es was an indication that efforts to beef up the libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors was bearing fruit .
" in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .
he revealed plans for further talks this month with libyan may@@ ors on economic development initiatives and with chad , niger and mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching europe .
lian ping , chief economist of the bank of communications , said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter , the growth rate of value added of industry in december could accelerate to 6.6 % .

industrial production , while weaker than that in october , will remain generally unchanged from that in november .
investment in china ’ s manufacturing sector was low in december , but infrastructure investment improved slightly . as such , fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in november .

beijing ’ s new measure to “ shift and re@@ locate institutions of higher learning ” : 10,000 buc@@ t teachers and students move into new campus at changping
the opening ceremony of beijing university of chemical technology ’ s ( buc@@ t ) new campus was held at the changping district of beijing on the 2@@ nd , and school officially comm@@ enced at the 1,@@ 800 mu green campus .
reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital ’ s core functions , and treating “ large urban center diseases ” , on the back of cooperative development among beijing , tianjin and hebei province as well as the shifting and relocation of non@@ -@@ capital related functions , beijing has accelerated the program to shift and re@@ locate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years . the teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are re@@ locating in batches to new campuses in shunyi , daxing , fang@@ shang and other suburban districts .
buc@@ t ’ s new campus is located in nan@@ kou town , changping , and sits on a land area of 1,@@ 800 mu , some 40 km from the city . it is a key project of beijing ’ s shifting and relocation of non@@ -@@ capital functions .
the new campus was constructed in three phases . phase i is now entirely completely , and phase ii is expected to comm@@ ence by the end of the year . on completion , the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met .
at this time , a review of this year ’ s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film .
at 17 : 10 today , the 119 command center at shaoyang received an emergency call . tetra@@ hydro@@ fur@@ an stored at hong@@ zhi chemical plant at long@@ xu@@ tang , shuang@@ xi district , caught fire .
shaoyang fire station immediately dispatched five deta@@ ch@@ ments and 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical protective clothing , chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene .
preliminary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which tetra@@ hydro@@ fur@@ an was stored . there was thick smoke at the scene .
at the time of filing this report , firefighters were in the processing of carrying out emergency rescue . the city ’ s health , safety administration , environmental protection , public security , traffic and other departments arrived at the scene successively . no fat@@ alities or injured persons were found .
michelle carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of conrad roy
a massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls .
michelle carter , now 20 , will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation .
carter was convicted in june of the involun@@ tary man@@ slaughter of conrad roy , who took his own life on 13 july 2014 .
mr roy 's father told thursday 's hearing : " my family is heart@@ broken .
my son was my best friend . "
carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal .
she had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal team argued that both she and mr roy suffered from mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse , carter stood tear@@ fully with hands clas@@ ped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced .
" her actions killed conrad roy , " the prosecutor told the court .
" she ended his life to better her own .
she has not accepted responsibility , " she said .
" she has shown no remorse . "
but carter 's lawyer said it was a " horrible circumstance that she completely regrets . "
however , judge lawrence mon@@ i@@ z said he did not find that her " age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions . "
a prosecutor read a statement from mr roy 's mother , lynn roy , saying there was " not one day i do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .
i want him to be proud of me and how i am handling everything - i am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity , " it said .
mr roy 's sister , cam@@ dy@@ n roy , testified that she was " haunted " by the real@@ isation that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be an aunt to his children .
" not having that one person i 've been with every day since birth is a pain i 'll always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .
the case appears to set a legal precedent , as there is no massachusetts law that crimin@@ al@@ ises telling a person to commit suicide .
carter was 17 when mr roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after carter 's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life .
" hang yourself , jump off a building , stab yourself i don 't know there 's a lot of ways , " she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : " you need to do it , conrad " and " all you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy . "
judge mon@@ i@@ z said carter sought attention through mr roy 's death , ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press .
the case has divided legal opinion .
among the few to defend carter was amanda kno@@ x , who was convicted of mur@@ dering her british roommate in italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago .
ms kno@@ x , 30 , published an op@@ -@@ ed in the los angeles times saying : " michelle carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . "

on the 2@@ nd , reporters learned from lhasa pure land basketball club that the lhasa pure land basketball youth team came in fourth at the national youth basketball league finals held in beijing .

after the competition ended , captain jiang cu@@ o said that he hoped to gain experience from taking part in the competition , and do his best for tibetan basketball .
it is understood that during the competition , the players had to overcome factors such as low altitude sickness , displaying the image of tibet .
the fact that track and field involves the most gold medals in the olympics makes those athletes confident a lot , the famous players have been disadvantaged in the competition .
audi to modify up to 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles as carmakers face back@@ lash
a day before audi 's announcement , bmw said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the bmw chairman said the company believed " there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , " referring to the european cities - including munich , where bmw is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
daimler announced on tuesday that it would modify three million mercedes vehicles in europe to reduce their diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the moves as recalls .
european carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in europe and the united states to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcin@@ ogens , and can cause asthma .
the cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutr@@ alize the f@@ umes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
as german automakers face scrutiny , the government of chancellor angela merkel has also been accused of co@@ dd@@ ling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of volkswagen , which covered up its use of so@@ -@@ called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested , but ease back in normal driving conditions .
several volkswagen executives have been charged in the united states , and others are under investigation on both sides of the atlantic .
last month , the former head of thermodynamics at audi 's engine development department was arrested in germany .
the former manager , z@@ ac@@ che@@ o gi@@ ov@@ anni pam@@ io , is italian , and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the united states .
early this year , audi was swept up into a german criminal investigation involving volkswagen after the authorities accused audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in europe , broad@@ ening an inquiry that had focused on the united states .
the inclusion of audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on volkswagen : the luxury car@@ maker accounts for a dis@@ propor@@ tionate share of volkswagen 's profit .
taking a couple of years , or even a few years , to make a film from planning to release is nothing unusual .
“ big fish & be@@ gon@@ ia ” , an animated feature film 12 years in the making , recently announced that it would be released on july 8@@ th .
liang xuan , the author of “ big fish & be@@ gon@@ ia ” , dropped out of his studies at the department of thermal engineering at tsinghua university when he was 21 , and founded b & t together with best friend zhang chun . in 2008 , ce yuan ventures provided us $ 1 million in risk investment , kick@@ -@@ starting the maiden animated film , “ big fish & be@@ gon@@ ia ” .
the film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas awards at the creative sample stage . it has been included in the centre pom@@ p@@ id@@ ou ’ s collection and accla@@ imed as “ an outstanding artwork ” .
as it took six years from creation to production , the film was known as a “ super decei@@ ver ” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release .
“ big fish & be@@ gon@@ ia ” is a chinese fantasy . the announcement of the tra@@ ilers for the scheduled release has once again led to new expectations among all viewers .
liang xuan said , “ i ’ ve only done this one thing in the last 12 years . now it has turned from a dream into reality . i ’ m both nervous and excited ” .
zhang chun said , “ i kept thinking of using one@@ -@@ fif@@ tieth of other people ’ s budget to come up with an image effect that was completely identical to these other people ’ s . i drove our entire team up the wall . ”
dongguan , the “ factory of the world ” which once made its fortune on industrial processing and large numbers of general workers , is looking to high@@ -@@ level talent to help the city re@@ position itself .
the dongguan government recently held a high@@ -@@ level talent week event . reporters from china business network noticed a number of repu@@ table local enterprises participating in the talent fair .
on the bright advertising board against a tang@@ er@@ ine colored wall , they listed their respective exor@@ bit@@ ant price tags .
therefore , china television drama production industry association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self@@ -@@ discipline convention .
prov@@ ence lavender under threat from climate change
it has become a symbol of prov@@ ence in southern france , but there is a warning that it 's under threat from climate change .
lavender is in decline because of dr@@ ough@@ t@@ -@@ like conditions and diseas@@ e@@ -@@ carrying insects , causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions .
eric cha@@ isse , an expert at the proven@@ ce@@ -@@ based agricultural research institute cri@@ ep@@ pam , said : " lavender in prov@@ ence is effectively endangered , because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn .
this affects the lifes@@ pan of lavender .
there 's also a small cic@@ ada , a micro@@ -@@ bacteria transmitting leaf hop@@ per , and in very dry weather there are lots of them . "
and a lot is at stake .
as well as attracting holid@@ ay@@ makers , lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics .
eric cha@@ isse said : " instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers , we have smaller ones , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . "
solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil , but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions .
compared to the sci@@ -@@ fi elements in the movie , the two lead actors said that it was the movie ’ s plot that attracted them .
on the afternoon of september 5 , west china city daily reporters consecu@@ tively interviewed numerous renowned personalities in the cross talk circle , as well as two cross talk arti@@ ste@@ s . what was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time .
one is a silver bear best actor , the other , an up@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ coming young actor ; “ guilty of mind ” is the first partnership between liao fan and li yifeng .
a journalist 's murder under@@ scores growing threat in mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meets on wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for coverage of the most recent may@@ hem wr@@ ought in sin@@ alo@@ a state by organized crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they 've come together to talk about security .
it 's important to change their routines , they are told .
two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : to take their children with them to the office , which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009 , or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room : ad@@ vers@@ aries , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug@@ -@@ traff@@ ickers , politicians , busines@@ spe@@ o@@ ple , journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the car@@ te@@ ls , a catalog of villa@@ ins who make the job of covering mexico 's chaos per@@ il@@ ous .
there is no resp@@ ite from the violence , and as bodies pile up across the country , more and more of them are journalists : at least 25 since president enri@@ que pen@@ a nie@@ to took office in december 2012 , according to the committee to protect journalists ; 5@@ 89 under federal protection after attacks and threats ; and so far this year , at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latest is their editor and inspiration , ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce co@@ -@@ founder ja@@ vier val@@ dez car@@ den@@ as .
" the greatest error is to live in mexico and to be a journalist , " val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on narco@@ -@@ violence .
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of val@@ dez displaying his middle finger , with the word " justice , " hangs on the facade of the ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building ; two reporters on their 30@@ s , aaron i@@ bar@@ ra and mi@@ ri@@ am ra@@ mi@@ re@@ z , wear t@@ -@@ shirts that display his smiling , bes@@ pec@@ tac@@ led face or his trademark panama hat .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death ; the reporters discuss their shared trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special federal prosecutor 's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists ' cases , it has only prosecuted two , according to the committee to protect journalists .
as with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they persist in covering the violence of sin@@ alo@@ a , though they are heart@@ broken , though the terrain is more treach@@ erous now .
without information on the killers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security , says i@@ bar@@ ra , is of little use .
" it 's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .
" as long as we don 't know why , you distrust everyone . "
on the morning of may 15 , val@@ dez left the ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in the state capital of cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red toyota corolla was stopped by two men ; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times , presumably for the name of the paper - which trans@@ lates as twelfth river .
the gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby .
val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rumors tend to fly freely in cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of val@@ dez , there 's practically nothing but silence .
since gu@@ z@@ man 's arrest last year and extradition to the united states in january , sin@@ alo@@ a has been one of the country 's bloo@@ di@@ est battle@@ grounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum .
never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in sin@@ alo@@ a , or that the cemetery is filled with or@@ nate , two@@ -@@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings , larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that a state of " calm " is when just one car@@ tel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug@@ -@@ trafficking routes to the united states .
despite that , and the fact that val@@ dez was inti@@ mately aware of the per@@ ils of his work , is@@ mail bo@@ jor@@ que@@ z , 60 , a co@@ -@@ founder and director of ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , is wr@@ acked with guilt for failing to protect his friend .
he believes two errors contributed to the killing .
first there was the publication in february of an interview with dam@@ aso lopez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tel factions at war with gu@@ z@@ man 's sons .
the piece may have angered the sons ; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to news@@ stands .
the second mistake was not forcing val@@ dez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story .
val@@ dez was a legend in mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in mexican violence against journalists .
he 'd survived for so long , his friends and colleagues assumed he 'd always be there .
he was a veteran reporter for nor@@ o@@ est@@ e in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling $ 50 shares .
in sin@@ alo@@ a , " it was impossible to do journalism without touching the nar@@ co issue , " said bo@@ jor@@ que@@ z .
over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage , and sales and advertising increased .
reporters loved being able to publish hard@@ -@@ hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover .
eight years after ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , it won the prestigious maria mo@@ ors cab@@ ot award for coverage in latin america .
that same year , val@@ dez won the international press freedom award of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the mexican drug story wherever it led .
he freely acknowledged that he was frightened .
" i want to carry on living , " he said at the time of the c@@ p@@ j award .
drug trafficking in sin@@ alo@@ a " is a way of life , " he said last october , in an interview with rom@@ pe@@ vien@@ to tv .
" you have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb .
i don 't want to be asked , ' what were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn 't you say what was going on ? ' "
the ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff misses val@@ dez , the jo@@ k@@ ester who swore like a long@@ sho@@ re@@ man , the friend generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they relied on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would go to el gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar across from the office , and would always sit at the same table .
now , they ask : was his love of routine his down@@ fall ?
his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive .
" they don 't like it if you mess with their women , their children , their clean businesses , their cl@@ an@@ dest@@ ine air@@ strips " used to move drugs .
" those things were off@@ -@@ limits , " said bo@@ jor@@ que@@ z .
the result is , even in the best of times , a high@@ -@@ level of self@@ -@@ censorship and self@@ -@@ preservation .
trusting one 's instincts .
if it smells wrong , stay away .
the trouble , said ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce editor and@@ res vill@@ ar@@ real , is that " smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with ja@@ vier happened . "
the old rules , he and others say , no longer apply in sin@@ alo@@ a - just as they don 't in ta@@ ma@@ u@@ lip@@ as , ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , guer@@ re@@ ro and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape constantly shifts .
in the room where ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff met for security training , suddenly no cell@@ phones were allowed ; days before , it was revealed that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in mexico .
outside , two police officers sought relief from the 10@@ 4@@ -@@ degree ( 40 celsius ) heat in the shade of a tree .
they were assigned by the state government to guard ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce 's offices , hou@@ sed in a four@@ -@@ story building in a middle@@ -@@ class neighborhood of cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half@@ -@@ jo@@ kingly , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy .
it has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside , where the drug gangs are in de facto control .
for this week 's edition ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was looking at three main stories .
there was the killing of former boxing great juli@@ o ces@@ ar chavez 's brother in sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor 's hometown .
and there was a group kidnapping in one of cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an 's most expensive restaurants , a block from the prosecutor 's office .
there was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened , so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traff@@ ickers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolution party , or pr@@ i , which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century .
recently several pr@@ i governors have been accused of corruption in high@@ -@@ profile cases .
vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of " el chap@@ o " gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
just months before , readers would have looked to val@@ dez 's column for the best@@ -@@ sour@@ ced information about the kidnapping .
" before , we would have already known what happened , " said vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nicknamed " el fl@@ aco " for his slender build .
" now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . "
val@@ dez 's office has been re@@ pur@@ posed as a storage room for signs and stickers prote@@ sting journalist killings , as staff have become something they never expected to be : activists on behalf of the press .
reporter mi@@ ri@@ am ra@@ mi@@ re@@ z grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor 's office over yet another journalist .
salvador ad@@ ame disappeared in the western state of mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an three days after val@@ dez was killed .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his , based on dna tests .
nationwide , journalists have become more vocal , scra@@ wling " sos press " on side@@ walks and buildings in organized protests .
on this day , the director bo@@ jor@@ que@@ z is away in washington , trying to rally international support for justice in the val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of sin@@ alo@@ a the day after val@@ dez was killed , ra@@ mi@@ re@@ z accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth .
she has since asked to be reas@@ signed from covering the government , concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity .
val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in mexico are " surrounded " by organized crime , compl@@ icit government officials and an indifferent society .
in his last book , " narco@@ -@@ journalism , " he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in ca@@ hoo@@ ts with organized crime .
the media watch@@ dog group artic@@ ul@@ o 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials .
" in mexico you die because they want to shut you up , " ra@@ mi@@ re@@ z said .
clearly , the murders have a chilling effect .
no one for@@ gets the death six years ago of blogger maria elizabeth mac@@ ias in the northern border state of ta@@ ma@@ u@@ lip@@ as .
her body was found along with a note pur@@ por@@ tedly signed by the z@@ et@@ as car@@ tel : " here i am because of my reports . "
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head .
some outlets have op@@ ted to close , such as the newspaper el nor@@ te , in the northern border state of chi@@ hua@@ hua , after the killing of correspondent mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va breach in march .
others keep going , as el man@@ ana of nu@@ evo la@@ re@@ do did following the killing of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , di@@ ario de ci@@ ud@@ ad ju@@ arez addressed the drug car@@ te@@ ls publicly with a front@@ -@@ page editorial titled , " what do you want from us ? "
some journalists have fled their home states or even the country .
it 's a wren@@ ching decision .
it 's hard to find work in exile , and they still scan the streets , looking for danger .
and sometimes , they are hunted down , as apparently was photographer rub@@ en es@@ pin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a mexico city apartment three months after fleeing ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it 's a daily dance of high@@ -@@ risk decisions .
i@@ bar@@ ra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him .
" mexico is going to hell , and that 's why i became a reporter , " he said .

size of china ’ s self drive tourism market may exceed r@@ mb@@ 1 trillion by 2020

at the same time however , the self drive travel market , the size of which is expected to exceed r@@ mb@@ 1 trillion , is confronted with twin challenges .
against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ easy travel , self drive tourism has received support from national policies , and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers .
at the same time however , the self drive travel market , the size of which is expected to exceed r@@ mb@@ 1 trillion , is confronted with twin challenges . on the one hand , the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand . self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with me@@ ager profits . on the other hand , self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages .
accounting for 60 % of total tourists in domestic tourism , with market size expected to exceed r@@ mb@@ 1 trillion
in 2016 , domestic tourism numbered some 4.@@ 44 billion persons , with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60 % of total tourists in domestic tourism . by 2020 , the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed r@@ mb@@ 1 trillion .
statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by china tourism automobile and cruise association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years . the share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50 % .
at the same time , all regions as well as the state have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism , this new emerging sector . from 2016 to 2017 , a sle@@ w of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel , and motor@@ home and camping tourism have been promulgated .
in july 2017 , eight government agencies including the china national tourism administration and the state general administration of sports jointly issued the “ plans for the development of automobile camp@@ sites for self drive sports ” . in the same month , in the “ action plan for advancing quality enhancement and upgrading in rural travel development ( 2017 ) “ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the national development and reform commission and the ministry of finance , self drive travel was mentioned as a priority .
the introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel .
self drive travel clubs make me@@ ager profits ; complete industry chain is key
although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market , and active guidance from national policy measures , the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage .
according to the “ 201@@ 6@@ -@@ 2017 annual report on the development of china ’ s self drive travel industry ” , domestic self drive travel clubs , automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands , tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion . the proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs , self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15 % .
meanwhile , there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel . many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers . some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers .
in terms of organizing self drive travel activities , this en@@ compass various aspects including “ board , lodging , transport , travel , shopping , entertainment ” . fragmentation is high , and upstream supply chain heavy . there is also significant random@@ ness in tourist spending .
li guan@@ jie , founder and ceo of beijing x@@ tx auto club , believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence . the primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities . the core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services .
however , there is significant product hom@@ ogeneity in route products within the self drive sector , and the standard of guide services is mixed . self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to re@@ structure .
it is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself . rather , it is an inter@@ -@@ regional and -@@ industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel . the creation of a complete industry chain is key .
experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption , experience is a more important consumption element .
hence , with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry , the experience feature should be enhanced . a “ self drive travel + ” theme as well as self drive travel product ip should be developed .
scenic routes are not merely roads , and automobile camp@@ sites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements
confronted with the rise in self drive travel , the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly ru@@ di@@ mentary .
li guan@@ jie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road . rather , traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it . however , building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department . the increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms , information centers , publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities . their degree of bonding with the tourism is low .
these could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “ us route 66 ” ,
the design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “ experience the joy of driving ” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route . scenic routes are able to connect spots and fac@@ ets of the travel landscape . these would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco@@ -@@ tourism resources along the route . meanwhile , various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience , creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry .
in addition to scenic routes , camp@@ sites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel .
however , a beijing news reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at camp@@ sites .
they believe that many camp@@ sites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements . considered low class with dull product features , they are unable to meet the multi@@ -@@ faceted demands of self drive travel .
an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago , enterprises operate camp@@ site mostly for the purpose of acquiring land . after they acquire the land , follow@@ -@@ up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up . these operators are los@@ s@@ -@@ making , and do not have later@@ -@@ stage capital injection . hence , providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult .
consumer groups
data published by the china tourism automobile and cruise association in 2017 showed that in terms of age , self drive travelers are concentrated in the 2@@ 1@@ -@@ 40 age group , mostly in the 3@@ 1@@ -@@ 40 co@@ hort . this group has a certain level of income , and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel . many are family oriented customers .
a survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non@@ -@@ standard lodging .
in terms of self drive travel categories , driving in neighboring areas is the pre@@ dominant category , accounting for 84 . 32 % .
self drive travel overseas is a dream for many , but the proportion is still relatively small .
meanwhile , with higher consumption demand , tourists who enjoyed self drive “ tour of sights ” have begun to change their opinion . instead of “ ali@@ gh@@ ting to take photos , and boarding to sleep ” during the self drive travel process , they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process .
dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one .
now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhin@@ o@@ -@@ sized creature found by a canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as ' the mona lisa of dinosaurs ' .
it was so well preserved , they were even able to determine the colour of its sc@@ aly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a ' troubled past ' .
the report in the journal current biology described it as ' the best@@ -@@ preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world . '
the fossil is a new@@ found species of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur , which lived mid@@ way through the cretaceous period , between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
it 's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers , who describe it as ' truly remark@@ able@@ '
the arm@@ oured plant@@ -@@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found , according to reports in national geographic .
it was found by shawn fun@@ k , when he was digging at the sun@@ cor mill@@ en@@ ium mine near fort mc@@ murray in northern alber@@ ta , canada , on march 21 , 2011 .
he hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to take a closer look .
the fossil he uncovered was sent to the royal tyr@@ rell museum of pale@@ ontology .
they spent the next six years working on un@@ covering the beast within the 2,@@ 5@@ 00@@ -@@ pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) lump of earth .
after all that hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled .
'@@ if you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was sleeping , ' said lead author cal@@ eb brown , a scientist at the royal tyr@@ rell museum where the creature is on display .
'@@ it will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the mona lisa of dinosaurs . '
by studying its skin , researchers found that this plant@@ -@@ e@@ ater , though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank , likely faced a significant threat from meat@@ -@@ eating dinosaurs .
the heavily arm@@ oured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and employed a shielding technique known as counter@@ -@@ shad@@ ing , which is also used by many modern@@ -@@ day animals .
this would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies , experts say , suggesting it was pre@@ yed on by larger dinosaurs .
the 1@@ 10@@ -@@ mil@@ lion@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old creature , part of the no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur family , first hit headlines in may and is now on view at the royal tyr@@ rell museum of pal@@ ae@@ ontology .
researchers have now studied and named the beast bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mitch@@ elli after museum technician mark mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painsta@@ kingly un@@ covering it .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for dr mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body .
they discovered counter@@ shad@@ ing , a common method of defence in the animal kingdom , which means the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although counter@@ shad@@ ing is common , the findings come as surprise because bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta 's size far exceeds that of counter@@ shad@@ ed animals alive today .
it suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat@@ -@@ eating dinosaurs that evolution fav@@ oured conceal@@ ment over confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that have counter@@ shad@@ ing -@@ - think deer , ze@@ bras or arma@@ dil@@ los -@@ - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey , signaling that this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur faced a real struggle to survive .
'@@ strong pre@@ dation on a massive , heav@@ ily@@ -@@ armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the cretaceous must have been , ' said brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur 's skin would have been reddish brown .
scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life , including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal .
they believe that when the dinosaur died , it fell into a river and was swept out to sea , where it sank on its back to the ocean floor .
at that time , alber@@ ta was as warm as south florida is today , and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now .
'@@ this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved sc@@ aly skin , yet is also preserved in three dimensions , retaining the original shape of the animal , ' said brown .
'@@ the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the early cretaceous .
you don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just squ@@ int your eyes a bit , you could almost believe it was sleeping . '
the cretaceous was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , meat@@ -@@ eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs , ro@@ amed the earth .
although the king of them all , ty@@ ran@@ no@@ saurus rex , lived millions of years after bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors .
they include acro@@ can@@ tho@@ saurus , a 38@@ ft ( 11.@@ 5@@ m ) long monster weighing six tonnes .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal current biology , believe bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was washed out to sea after it died and mum@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by shawn fun@@ k , when he was digging at the mill@@ en@@ ium mine near fort mc@@ murray in northern alber@@ ta , canada , on march 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved arm@@ oured dinosaur in the world , including skin and armour , and is complete from the sn@@ out to hips .
the creatures were around 18 feet ( five metres ) long on average , and weighted up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it featured two 20@@ -@@ in@@ ch@@ -@@ long spikes which pro@@ tr@@ uded from its shoulders .
the researchers believe that the this armored plant@@ -@@ e@@ ater lum@@ bered through what is now western canada , until a flooded river swept it into open sea .
but the dinosaur 's under@@ sea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail .
the fos@@ sil@@ ised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur 's skull .
as michael gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for national geographic , such level of preservation ' is a rare as winning the lottery .
the more i look at it , the more mind@@ -@@ bo@@ ggling it becomes .
fos@@ sil@@ ized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates do@@ tting the animal 's skull .
its right fore@@ foot lies by its side , its five digits s@@ played upward .
i can count the scales on its sole . '
reporters understand that adding alg@@ inate , hum@@ ic acid and amino acid nutrient carriers of natural or plant sources into the production process of urea would change modify and enhance the benefit of traditional urea . the alg@@ inate urea , zinc ful@@ vate urea and amin@@ og@@ lu@@ tan@@ ic acid urea nitrogen utilization rate was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than general urea .
in a positive environment , an increase in crop yield potential will be significant ; in particular , large valu@@ e@@ -@@ added urea pal@@ lets are quality raw materials for bulk blending fertilizer .
the total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 london olympics .
in order to ensure the safety of the rio olympics , brazil will start the largest ever security linkage plan .
earlier , brazil government has said that a total of 8@@ 5,000 troops and pol@@ ices , including 20,000 troops and 6@@ 5,000 pol@@ ices , will fight together for the security of the olympics .
most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the olympic venues , while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports , subway stations and streets .
the pol@@ ices will patrol around other areas of the city , including sub@@ ways , buses and streets .
it is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in rio and provided security services for the olympics .
in addition to the four competition areas , they will also patrol airports and main roads connecting airports to the olympic venues .
appraisal mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new . the key to having these appraisal mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision , rather than being a mere form@@ ality .
how one activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' whose streets ? '
on aug@@ . 9 , 2014 , britt@@ any fer@@ rell was shaken to her core .
just a day after arriving in new york city on a trip , the st@@ . louis native sat on the bed of an air@@ bn@@ b she was renting , sc@@ rolling through facebook on her phone .
she stumbled upon a post from someone from high school .
" the police just killed an 18 year old kid and he 's still laying in the street , " it read .
confused , noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information , she closed facebook and opened twitter .
a user with the handle @ the@@ e@@ phar@@ o@@ ah was being constantly ret@@ wee@@ ted onto her timeline .
the st@@ . lou@@ is@@ -@@ area ra@@ pper was live@@ -@@ twee@@ ting the death of michael brown , an unarmed black 18@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old killed by a white police officer in ferguson , mo .
he posted a picture of brown 's lifel@@ ess body stretched out in the street , where it would stay for four hours .
" this is wild , " fer@@ rell thought to herself .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put down her phone only to return later that evening to twee@@ ts about people gathering on can@@ field drive .
there were photos of police tape and people yelling , and of a guy claiming to be brown 's father holding a sign that read , " ferguson police just killed my unarmed son ! "
she watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog .
in another video , a different cop , she said , coc@@ ked his rifle and screamed , " i 'll kill all you ... animals . "
" ' this is not usual , ' " fer@@ rell recalled saying .
" ' this isn 't the type of murder that we 've become used to and can call typical . ' 
in that moment i felt ch@@ ills .
i was angry and crying . "
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 p.@@ m. , she picked up her 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old daughter from her dad 's house and decided the two of them would head to ferguson the next morning .
what happened , to fer@@ rell and to ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary , " whose streets ? , " in theaters aug@@ . 11 .
it 's a tale of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the v@@ ant@@ age point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers .
as fer@@ rell drove to ferguson with her daughter , who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown , the two re@@ visited a conversation they 'd had countless times before that morning " about the black experience and black condition . "
" you remember how i taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in ? " she recalled saying .
" we 're going to ferguson right now because the police killed an 18@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old boy and it wasn 't right .
i couldn 't not take her , " fer@@ rell said later .
" this happening today is a cul@@ mination of ... that has happened in the past .
she needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .
she needs to be well developed in the area of not just acti@@ vis@@ m and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free , to free ourselves .
even if i 'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn 't personally experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black woman@@ -@@ child .
i feel like i would be doing her a dis@@ service to shield her from that . "
the first stop when they arrived in ferguson was on south flor@@ iss@@ ant road , a site across from the police department that became a camp@@ ground of sorts as the activists awaited word of officer dar@@ ren wilson 's event@@ ual non@@ -@@ indictment .
there fer@@ rell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lun@@ ches .
they prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters .
slowly , a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape for fer@@ rell .
" my acti@@ vis@@ m completely transformed after aug@@ . 9 , " she said , noting that while an under@@ gra@@ d at the university of mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ -@@ st . louis , she was president of the minority student nurses ass@@ n@@ . and focused on food justice and health dispar@@ ities in black communities .
" i had no experience in organizing .
it all just came . "
weeks later , fer@@ rell met sab@@ aah fol@@ a@@ yan , one of the film 's co@@ -@@ directors , during an evening demonstration .
fol@@ a@@ yan said she and her director of photography lucas al@@ var@@ ado@@ -@@ far@@ ra@@ r " just wanted to document " what was happening .
a question came to fer@@ rell 's mind : " do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit ? "
that skep@@ ticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience .
as fol@@ a@@ yan explained in a recent interview , " we had heard that people who are born and raised in ferguson were not having their voices centered , and we wanted to do it differently . "
fol@@ a@@ yan had already linked up with co@@ -@@ director damon davis , an area artist known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around death row inmates .
his involvement ende@@ ared fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other locals the " whose streets ? " team followed in the years after brown 's shooting .
" this documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us , it 's us speaking , " davis said .
" that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , because that 's how i will be represented . "
while the goal wasn 't to focus on fer@@ rell 's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is " not about a m@@ essi@@ ah leader but a community coming together , " fol@@ a@@ yan said - she proved to be the most open of the film 's participants .
as a result , " whose streets ? " documents surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ rell 's life , like falling in love and marrying her wife .
" i felt like i was naked , " said fer@@ rell , laughing about the first time she saw the finished product .
" but i understood that with doing this work and human@@ izing black folks , there has to be a level of vulnerability . "
moreover , fer@@ rell 's story reiter@@ ates and re@@ -@@ centers the role of black que@@ er women in the broader black lives matter movement .
two of the movement 's three founders - who co@@ ined # black@@ li@@ ves@@ matter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen tra@@ y@@ von martin - identify as que@@ er .
" black que@@ er women in leadership has sustained the movement overall , " said fer@@ rell , " and that 's because we 're constantly at battle on multiple fronts .
black que@@ er women have to bear the br@@ unt of it all . "
fol@@ a@@ yan agreed noting that " the movement is really uph@@ eld by black women and a lot of que@@ er black women . "
she insists , however , that " this is not some affirmative action type of thing " where fer@@ rell was chosen as the film 's heart because of her identities .
" she was the person who was galvan@@ izing this energy , " she said .
" it 's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines , because living life at those inter@@ sections as a black que@@ er woman , you have so much on the line .
you can feel her energy through the screen . "
meanwhile , back in ferguson , the news cameras are long gone but fra@@ ught racial ties between the community and police persist .
fer@@ rell is on probation for 2 ½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o@@ -@@ political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply : " a mess . "
still , she cl@@ ings to a chant she 's committed to memory since taking to ferguson 's streets a full three years ago .
" it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose but our chains . "
online translation services were actually already available on the internet a decade ago , and in fact , a very long time ago , there was a prevalent view that “ machines will replace human translation ” .
a becoming resem@@ blance : artist creates portraits using chelsea man@@ ning 's dna
in the center of the room at new york 's fri@@ d@@ man gallery are multiple faces - white , black and brown , each bearing an almost imper@@ cep@@ tible resem@@ blance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist heather de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g from cheek sw@@ abs and hair cli@@ ppings sent to her by chelsea man@@ ning .
man@@ ning sent the cli@@ ppings from the fort lea@@ ven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35@@ -@@ year sentence after fam@@ ously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website wi@@ kil@@ eaks .
the new exhibition , which opened on 2 august , is titled a becoming resem@@ blance .
it 's the product of two years of correspondence between de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g , whose discipline combines her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and man@@ ning , a trans woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent whose sentence was commu@@ ted by barack obama when he had just three days left in office .
by algorith@@ mic@@ ally analyzing dna extracted from man@@ ning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like , de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g has created a tren@@ chant , if somewhat cerebral , commentary on not only the mal@@ le@@ ability of dna data - the many ways it can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of those interpretations - but also identity .
man@@ ning , who was born bradley edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence , was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges , including six espionage act violations , computer fraud and theft .
from prison , her image was repres@@ sed , so much so that there was just one photo - a granular , black@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white sel@@ fie in which man@@ ning , visi@@ bly uneasy , sits in a driver 's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated .
in 2015 , de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project , stranger visions .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette but@@ ts and chewing gum , extracting dna from the de@@ tr@@ itus to con@@ j@@ ure an image of what these folks might look like .
that was when she received an email from paper magazine .
" they were conducting an interview with chelsea man@@ ning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article , " de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn 't be visited and she couldn 't be photographed at that time , so they reached out to chelsea and asked if she 'd be interested in having a dna portrait made .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became unlikely pen p@@ als , exchanging several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic book , suppressed images , illustrated by sho@@ ili kan@@ un@@ go , that en@@ visi@@ oned a future where the president would comm@@ ute chelsea 's sentence and she 'd be able to see the exhibition in person .
that obama would indeed call for man@@ ning 's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of seren@@ di@@ pity after seven brutal years at a military prison in kansas .
there 's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now , as donald trump wages war on government lea@@ kers and trans@@ gender troops while finding new , twee@@ table ways to further inf@@ lame the stark divisions he 's been called on to mend .
when asked about the peculiar timing of it all , de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g said that " things happen for a reason . "
in an artist statement written on the gallery 's wall , man@@ ning 's super@@ -@@ sized signature below it ( the " i " in her last name dotted with a heart ) , called for an end to the " automatic fac@@ tionalism that gender , race , sexuality , and culture have been the basis of . "
on the opposite wall is her mitochondrial dna sequence - a centi@@ pe@@ de of cs and gs and as , written in pencil .
by including the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des , per the artist 's sophisticated scientific le@@ xic@@ on ) , de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g hoped to illustrate how ast@@ ound@@ ingly similar , at least in biological makeup , we all are .
" what i 'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn 't care about who we are , and how open genetic data is to interpretation , how subjective it is , " said de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g , whose 2007 video work , spur@@ ious memories , is also on display .
" dna data can tell so many different stories , so this is 30 of those stories . "
the final piece in the exhibition , which is contained in a single room , is one page from the afore@@ mentioned graphic novel@@ la .
it shows man@@ ning , emerging , king kong@@ -@@ es@@ que , from the united states dis@@ i@@ pl@@ inary barracks with a spea@@ ker@@ phone in hand .
" when they chill your speech , then they 've won , " it reads .
" so never shut up . "
" it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , " the artist , who ha@@ ils from philadelphia , said .
" i get goo@@ se@@ bumps still talking about it . "
man@@ ning hasn 't seen the exhibition in@@ -@@ person yet - as was so pres@@ ci@@ ently imagined in the comic book - but when she does , she 'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks , her own genomic simul@@ ac@@ ra con@@ gre@@ gated like hor@@ des of protesters .
that was purpose@@ ful , too , as is everything in the exhibition , down to the height ( 5 " 2 , man@@ ning 's st@@ ature ) at which her genetic ha@@ plo@@ groups were written in pencil .
" in the past , i 've had them on the wall but i wanted them to feel like a crowd , " de@@ we@@ y@@ -@@ ha@@ g@@ bor@@ g said of the portraits .
" i wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with chelsea , like the movement that was behind free@@ ing her as well . "
northwestern professor and oxford university employee wanted for homicide
a nationwide man@@ hunt is underway for a northwestern university professor and an oxford university employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fat@@ ally stabbed inside a luxury chicago apartment , police said .
on monday , first@@ -@@ degree murder warrants without bail were issued for w@@ yn@@ d@@ ham la@@ them , 42 , and andrew warren , 56 , for their alleged involvement in the death of tren@@ ton h@@ . james corn@@ ell@@ -@@ dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , cook county court records show .
the documents say corn@@ ell@@ -@@ dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u , 26 , died after being stabbed multiple times .
a community alert released by the chicago police department says the body was discovered on july 27 .
officers received a call and arrived at the grand plaza apartments and found the victim with several lac@@ er@@ ations on his body .
corn@@ ell@@ -@@ dur@@ an@@ lea@@ u was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stab@@ bing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects , officials said .
la@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at northwestern university since 2007 .
alan k@@ . cub@@ bage , the vice president for university relations , said in an e@@ mailed statement that la@@ them is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering northwestern university campuses .
" this is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities , and northwestern university is cooperating in that investigation , " cub@@ bage said .
warren is a senior treasury assistant at oxford university .
a spokesperson for the university and som@@ er@@ ville college said in an e@@ mailed statement that , " we have been in contact with the police in the uk and are ready to help the us investigating authorities in any way they need . "
the statement added that warren 's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in .
chief communications officer of the chicago police department anthony gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities .
" police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying , " gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects .
gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said police received a call from the grand plaza building manager who had just received a cry@@ p@@ tic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 10@@ 08 .
police described the scene as very gru@@ esome .
gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on july 27 .

" we 'll complete w@@ ada road@@ map in near future " - russian deputy pm mut@@ ko
russian deputy prime minister vit@@ aly mut@@ ko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining world anti@@ -@@ doping agency ( w@@ ada ) criteria for the rein@@ statement of the russian anti@@ -@@ doping agency ( rus@@ ada ) .
" a certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out , rus@@ ada obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with uk@@ ad ( uk anti@@ -@@ doping ) .
the w@@ ada road@@ map was updated in this regard , " mut@@ ko stated on thursday .
the pm was comm@@ enting on the second part of w@@ ada 's road@@ map to code compliance , which describes the criteria for the rein@@ statement of rus@@ ada and which recently published on the organization 's website .
according to mut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern for russia .
" everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the international olympic committee [ ioc ] and w@@ ada in the near future , " he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that russian anti@@ -@@ doping authorities must publ@@ ically accept the reported outcomes of the wad@@ a@@ -@@ sanc@@ tioned investigation by canadian lawyer richard m@@ claren on alleged state@@ -@@ sponsored doping in russian sport .
referring to the matter , mut@@ ko said : " we are conducting the investigation , as our anti@@ -@@ doping system admitted a failure .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that didn 't exist . "
mut@@ ko 's words echoed those of vit@@ aly sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of russia 's independent public anti@@ -@@ doping commission .
talking to russian outlet r@@ sport earlier in the day , sm@@ ir@@ nov admitted past problems in russian anti@@ -@@ doping bodies , but added : " we have said on numerous occasions , that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one plans to accept this report unconditionally , " sm@@ ir@@ nov added .
rus@@ ada was suspended from carrying out doping controls within russia by w@@ ada in november 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal .
it was , however , permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and uk anti@@ -@@ doping ( uk@@ ad ) this june .
following a visit to the organization 's headquarters in moscow in july , w@@ ada director general oli@@ vier nig@@ g@@ li stated that rus@@ ada is " moving in the right direction " to be rein@@ stated .

forget purchasing agents ! these 8@@ 000@@ -@@ plus products enjoy zero tariff
at the regular press conference of the ministry of commerce ( mof@@ com ) held on january 11@@ th , spokesperson gao feng said that to date , china has 15 free trade agreements ( ft@@ as ) in force , involving 23 countries and regions , encomp@@ assing more than 8@@ 000 imported products at zero tariff .
meanwhile , you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics , salmon from iceland , red wine from chile , tropical fruits from asean ....
currently , china has signed 16 ft@@ as , involving 24 countries and regions , of which 15 have come into effect , encomp@@ assing more than 8@@ 000 imported products at zero tariff .
take agricultural produce for example . the implementation of the ft@@ as has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year .
for instance , import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products : tropical fruits from asean such as dur@@ ians , ly@@ che@@ es , and pit@@ aya from 15@@ -@@ 30 % previously ;
salmon from iceland , from 10@@ - 12 % ; and
red wine from georgia and chile , from 14@@ -@@ 30 % .
specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder from new zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs .
industrial products have benefited as well . for example , import tariffs for some cosmetics from switzerland have been reduced to zero , while
that for some watches have fallen to 50 % , and will fall further to zero in a few years ’ time ;
products from south korea such as refrigerators , rice coo@@ kers , massage devices , and cosmetic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40 % , and fall further to zero in a few years ’ time ;
and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs .
products at zero tariff under the ft@@ as also include intermedi@@ ates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end@@ -@@ user consumer goods , which will , to a certain extent , also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods .
mof@@ com spokesperson gao feng said that approximately one@@ -@@ third of china ’ s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the ft@@ as , of which the majority are end@@ -@@ user consumer goods , thus providing tangible benefits to consumers .
further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods
on december 1 , 2017 , china further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods . the reductions covered 18@@ 7 ei@@ ght@@ -@@ digit hs codes comprising food , health supplements , pharmaceuticals , chemical products for daily use , clothing , footwear and head@@ gear , home appliances , culture and recreation , miscellaneous and sun@@ dry goods , as well as other consumer goods .
the average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than hal@@ ved , plun@@ ging from 17.@@ 3 % to 7.7 % !
with effect from january 1 , 2018 , partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs .
the import tariffs of lipstick , eye shadow , perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10 % to 5 % .
this decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like .

foreign press : year@@ -@@ end return policies at us malls vary widely ; be cautious when returning gifts
china news service , december 29
us@@ -@@ based “ world journal ” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after christmas .
a report by american broadcasting company ( abc ) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last christmas were exchanged or returned .
elsewhere , readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online . shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites .
in general , large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures , but if you have shop@@ ped for gifts at certain small stores or online , you must be careful .
a madame hou of row@@ land heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $ 60 ( usd , the same hereinafter ) on december 1 , local time , but has yet to receive her purchase .
she sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store .
elsewhere , a netizen revealed that when on tour in the us last year , he bought a mobile phone from a third@@ -@@ party seller , but received a box of plas@@ tic@@ ine on delivery instead .
after he realized he was deceived , he applied for a refund from the website . fortunately , he was able to receive a full refund .
nonetheless , some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect .
mr wang , an ethnic chinese resident of northern california , purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $ 4 each but both times , the goods failed to arrive promptly .
he applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply .
large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies .
most of macy ’ s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days ,
but the merchandise has to be in its “ original ” state , and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record .
without proof of purchase , the customer may also receive the store ’ s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise .
target has a 90@@ -@@ day return deadline for general merchandise . for electronic products , the deadline is normally 15 days ,
but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between november 1 and december 25 , 2017 ;
note that the 30@@ -@@ day return deadline begins on december 25 , i.@@ e@@ . , merchandise purchased must be returned by january 25 , 2018 .
the ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development
more than 10 years ago , china was , on the whole , still a sellers ’ market . selection was limited , and so was demand .
a decade hence , the market has long developed into a buyers ’ rather than that of a sellers ’ market . shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well , and are no longer satisfied simply with a “ cash on delivery of goods ” shopping behavior .
therefore , how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers .
of the many factors that affect a shop@@ per ’ s shopping experience , the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important .
let ’ s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience .
no two leaves are alike , nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls . a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics .
take turkey ’ s world@@ -@@ renowned k@@ any@@ on shopping center . its unique un@@ dul@@ ating architectural design was inspired by the grand canyon , hence its hom@@ op@@ hon@@ ous name k@@ any@@ on . you feel like you ’ re in the grand canyon when walking along the 200@@ -@@ meter foot@@ path in the mid@@ section of k@@ any@@ on .
in addition to the can@@ yon@@ -@@ like design , there is a large unique inward concave o@@ val@@ -@@ shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held .
its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “ canyon ” , and the scene changes as you take each step .
in china , the nanjing forest mall commercial street , known as the country ’ s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue , is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales .
with a 7,000 sq@@ m green plaza , and a 3,000 sq@@ m roof@@ top water feature , the project is made up of nine individual buildings , linked by a sky bridge . the sun@@ ken garden design for the entire project , plane trees as its architectural surface , and the roof@@ top water feature create the feeling of being in a forest .
on entering the forest mall , you ’ d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in alice ’ s adventures in wonder@@ land . the tall tree trun@@ ks surround the buildings , and the lawn and stream are beautifully ju@@ x@@ tap@@ o@@ sed , drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality .
then there is chon@@ qing . the lijia waterfront business district built by longhu properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses , and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores , with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together .
in addition , the lijia waterfront business district will also integrate ecology into architecture . based on a trans@@ it@@ -@@ oriented development ( to@@ d ) concept , it integrates shopping , household services and amenities , dining , entertainment , education and sports , providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affor@@ ding them the luxury of enjoying chongqing ’ s unique “ waterfront culture ” , a perfect blend of shopping , and water entertainment and recreation .
from the above examples , it is noted that , at present , a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon . insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future .
today ’ s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods . rather , they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes ; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living .
therefore , in addition to meeting the one@@ -@@ stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers , maxim@@ izing the transmission of multi@@ -@@ ti@@ ered cultural and artistic spiritual needs , as well as bringing the li@@ vable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development .
in chongqing , guo@@ xing property ’ s bei@@ an@@ jiangshan is located north of the yangtze river , close to guanyin bridge , where the who ’ s who of world business and international giants agglomer@@ ate , and first class brands con@@ gre@@ gate , affor@@ ding a seamless connection with international fashion .
here , prosperity ab@@ ounds , and the best in the world agglomer@@ ate .
dong@@ yuan@@ jin@@ yue , which is in the immediate vicinity of nanping business district , has a better shopping environment . at its sole disposal is western china ’ s , and indeed , the nation ’ s leading four@@ -@@ story three@@ -@@ dimensional transportation system , enhancing shopping comfort .
elsewhere , the landsc@@ aped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at hu@@ igong road and wanda plaza have been upgraded , with approximately 300 trees planted , and 40,000 sq@@ m of floor space re@@ vam@@ ped , lifting the image of nanping business district .
meanwhile , longhu ’ s waterfront city , in the immediate vicinity of chongqing ’ s first low@@ -@@ density waterfront business district - lijia waterfront business district - is surrounded by nine parks . the commercial street district is low density with good access . these qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay , stop and slowing sav@@ or the joy of shopping when shopping , rather than being jo@@ st@@ led by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward . here , “ shopping at a leisurely pace ” is truly achieved .
competition will only intensify going forward . in a market of rampant homogen@@ ization , how to achieve success , and attain a reputation as a “ shopping mec@@ ca ” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers .
a differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient . only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts , em@@ path@@ ize with shoppers , and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assa@@ iled by intense competition .
to be sure , i believe that , at the end of the day , chongqing ’ s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts . a decade ago , no one would have imagined today ’ s prosperity .
shopping carnival : consum@@ er@@ ism revel@@ ry masks true environmental cost
r@@ mb@@ 16@@ 8.2 billion . that was the amount of money tmall users spent over a 24@@ -@@ hour period on november 11 , 2017 at the “ tmall 11.@@ 11 global shopping festival ” .
specifically , in the span of three minutes right after the “ double 11 ” comm@@ enced , tmall ’ s transaction volume surpassed r@@ mb@@ 10 billion , and exceeded r@@ mb@@ 20 billion in six minutes and five seconds ; within nine hours , it broke through the r@@ mb@@ 100 billion mark .
that day , shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.@@ 48 billion payments by way of alipay , an increase of 41 % year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year .
such spending resulted in 8@@ 12 million logistics orders .
whether the tmall shopping platform or the alipay payment platform , however , both belonged to jack ma ’ s alibaba group .
ten years ago , no one would have imagined that the “ singles ’ day ” sub@@ culture which was a self@@ -@@ de@@ prec@@ ating celebration created by singles on november 11 would be co@@ -@@ op@@ ted by e@@ -@@ commerce merchants , and turned into a phenomen@@ al “ singles ’ day ” shopping carnival today .
alibaba used the “ great singles ’ day sale ” marketing gim@@ mick : not dating ? singles , come shop online - for the first time on november 11 , 2009 .
the outcome was a surprise . that day , transactions at taobao mall ( the predecessor of “ tmall ” ) surpassed r@@ mb@@ 52 million , 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time .
from then on , “ double 11 ” has become a shopping festival created by alibaba , and has grown and expanded from a domestic buy@@ er@@ -@@ seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants . nine years hence , and the more than r@@ mb@@ 100 billion worth of transactions of tmall ’ s “ double 11 ” is now more than 3@@ 200 times that of the first year , far out@@ stripping that of “ black friday ” .
numerous e@@ -@@ commerce merchants have followed tmall ’ s “ double 11 ” sales promotion , with “ j@@ d.@@ com ” the strongest competitor .
“ j@@ d.@@ com ” has its own shopping festival “ 6.@@ 18 ” but its impact is less than that of “ double 11 ” . from november 1 to 11 this year , “ j@@ d.@@ com ” ’ s accumulated sales amounted to r@@ mb@@ 12@@ 7.1 billion .
the “ double 12 ” discount extravag@@ an@@ za and the christ@@ mas@@ -@@ new year shopping period come right after “ double 11 ” .
following the new year , pre@@ -@@ spring festival ’ s lunar new year shopping as well as valentine 's day shopping await the chinese consumer . retail consumption knows no holiday .
massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems , which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions .
a xinhua daily telegraph report revealed that based on the industry ’ s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging car@@ tons , at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year ’ s “ singles ’ day ” period .
liu hua , director of the pollution prevention program at green@@ peace east asia told china@@ dialogue that the volume of orders at this year ’ s “ singles ’ day ” from tmall alone would generate 16@@ 0,000 tonnes of packaging trash .
in 2016 , the state post bureau published a report stating that approximately 7@@ 80 million items were delivered by express cou@@ ri@@ ers during the 2015 “ singles ’ day ” period ( november 11@@ -@@ 16 ) , with more than 3 billion woven bags , 9.@@ 9@@ 22 billion packaging car@@ tons , and 16.@@ 9@@ 85 billion meters of adhesive tape used . the length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 4@@ 25 times .
this year , the state post bureau estimates that the “ singles ’ day ” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items .
wang shi , manager of a waste incineration plant in beijing told xinhua news agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “ singles ’ day ” , exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant .
express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored .
some e@@ -@@ commerce logistics enterprises , including suning , have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “ singles ’ day ” , as well as recy@@ cl@@ able packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly . however , acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low .
jack ma , on weibo , has also called on the logistics industry to support “ green packaging ” and “ green logistics ” .
this weibo received more than 6@@ 8,000 “ likes ” .
what sort of mobile payment do germans want ?
zhang dongfang : the mobile payment war w@@ aged in germany is nothing new .
all wechat pay and alipay did was to move the battle@@ ground to europe . neither the competitors nor the battle@@ ground has changed - the chinese ; is this really globalization ?
where there ’ s alipay , there ’ s wechat pay .
according to the agreement with germany ’ s electronic payment services provider wi@@ rec@@ ard , wechat pay officially entered germany in november this year . the chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in europe .
this time round , the reunion of the two “ fellow country@@ men ” in a foreign country took place in europe .
all along , alipay and wechat pay have been riding high on the road to globalization .
in a study on china ’ s mobile internet payment ’ s globalization methods , i@@ research consulting ’ s “ 2017 china 's third@@ -@@ party mobile payment report ” arrived at two methods : the first method would be by way of strategic investment , outward transfer of experience , taking an equity stake , and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise ;
the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through chinese tourists ’ overseas spending behavior , thereby changing overseas local entities ’ recognition and acceptance of china ’ s mobile payments .
indeed , win over the chinese , and you win the world .
china ’ s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by chinese tourists in europe is an attractive figure ,
but this also means that the mobile payment war w@@ aged in germany is nothing new .
all wechat pay and alipay did was to move the battle@@ ground to europe . neither the competitors nor the battle@@ ground has changed - it ’ s still the chinese ; is this really globalization ?
a more ground@@ breaking inquiry would be whether china ’ s mobile payment can expand its territory in europe .
germany is an example .
magical “ new retail ”
chen xin@@ lei , yang kai@@ han : when amazon made it to the world ’ s top 10 list of retailers , it announced that it would venture into the book@@ stores and grocery stores ; this is worth pondering , both in terms of opportunity and motive .
in november 2015 , amazon opened its first physical bookstore in seattle . this was followed by two book@@ stores in portland and san diego .
at the beginning of 2017 , amazon opened its bookstore and new york , and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year .
almost at the same time , amazon announced that its check@@ out@@ -@@ free grocery store amazon go would begin trial operations . no waiting in line or checkout is necessary . all customers have to do is scan their qr code on the amazon go app to enter the store , take the products they want and leave . the shopping amount would be charged to the customers ’ amazon account .
as far as amazon is concerned , its sudden but frequent for@@ ays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected .
this is because way back in 2007 , ceo jeff bez@@ os , in his “ letter to shareholders ” , highlighted that amazon would not arbitrarily start a new business ( such as a physical store ) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously :
1 . we must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in amazon ;
2@@ . we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company ;
3@@ . we must believe that the opportunity is currently under@@ served ; and
4@@ . we have the capabilities needed to bring strong custom@@ er@@ -@@ facing differentiation to the marketplace .
book@@ stores and grocery stores are the two most pre@@ car@@ ious physical retail sub@@ -@@ sectors , and were the first to be knocked out after the rise of amazon .
when amazon made it to the world ’ s top 10 list of retailers , it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets ; this is worth pondering , both in terms of opportunity and motive .
did amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders ?
similar words were echoed at the other end of the world . on the morning of october 13 , 2016 , at the computing conference 2016 held in yun@@ qi , hangzhou , alibaba chairman jack ma said in his keynote address that ,
“ from next year on@@ ward , alibaba will no longer talk about ‘ e@@ -@@ commerce ’ .
the era of pure e@@ -@@ commerce firms will soon come to an end . e@@ -@@ commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years , replaced instead by ‘ new retail ’ .
only by combining online and offline operations will new retail come into being . ”
in an instant , it was as if the words “ new retail ” took on magical properties , and became the new cat@@ ch@@ phrase of industry insiders .
so what is “ new retail ” exactly ?
if it merely referred to on@@ line@@ -@@ offline integration , then the concept is nothing new .
in 2016 , e@@ marke@@ ter , after tracking 180 of the largest e@@ -@@ commerce firms , estimated that total sales of e@@ -@@ commerce firms amounted to approximately us $ 200 billion , of which the largest 25 accounted for more than us $ 15@@ 9 billion ;
and of these 25 , 18 were traditional retailers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years ( such as macy ’ s , nor@@ d@@ strom , target and gap ) .
indeed , alibaba group 's r@@ mb@@ 28.@@ 3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in suning commerce group was still fresh in the minds of the public .
from a global perspective , both retailers and e@@ -@@ commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi@@ -@@ channel retail system that encomp@@ asses physical stores , e@@ -@@ commerce , mobile terminals and social media .
could jack ma ’ s “ new retail ” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future ?
if not , then what is the difference between the multi@@ -@@ channel concept and “ new retail ” ?
perhaps , the cru@@ x of the matter is not whether online and offline entities would integrate , but how .
a review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e@@ -@@ commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retailers many years ago ; both were focused on price and convenience .
on the basis of these two trigger points , e@@ -@@ commerce firms moved highly standardized products , such as books and cds , online from offline .
as online retail habits formed , and customer experience continued to rise , e@@ -@@ commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories , and began to increase efficiency .
in ali@@ ab@@ aba ceo daniel zhang ’ s words , “ use the thinking behind and technology of the internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retailers in society at this time , so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of chinese consumers may be effectively met . this will make the entire goods production , circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the internet and big data . ”
thus , the path of e@@ -@@ commerce firms is asse@@ t@@ -@@ light on the surface , but asse@@ t@@ -@@ heavy in reality .
“ light ” refers to fixed assets , head@@ count , management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retailers ; “ heavy ” refers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment .
changes in logis@@ tical methods ensured the efficiency of e@@ -@@ commerce firms .
the chinese central government ’ s official web portal reported that premier li keqiang presided over the state council executive meeting held on april 28 , which was of the opinion that expanding domestic consumption was a key measure for stable growth and structural transformation .
the meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly put forward specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation .
the import tariffs of some foreign goods for daily use for which domestic consumers have enormous demand will be lowered on a trial basis with effect from june this year , and tariff reductions will be extended to more goods over time .
together with the tax reform , consumption tax policies for general consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics will be optimized , with overall adjustments made to the scope of taxation , tax rates , and the different parts of the taxation process .
more port of entry du@@ ty@@ -@@ free shops will be set up and restored , and the variety of du@@ ty@@ -@@ free goods will be expanded appropriately , with the value of du@@ ty@@ -@@ free shopping increased by a certain amount so that domestic consumers would find it convenient to purchase foreign products in china .
shopping and customs clearance , as well as tax refund for foreign tourists would expedi@@ ted , and the requirement for voluntary tax declaration of imported goods shall be strictly implemented according to the law .
policies that support the inspection and quarantine of cross@@ -@@ border e@@ -@@ commerce imports shall be formulated , and unreasonable fees per@@ taining to imports shall be put in order .
the program to promote the brands of chinese products shall be accelerated , the development of physical stores supported , and on@@ line@@ -@@ offline interaction achieved .
market order shall be normalized , and strong measures shall be taken to crack down on counterfeit and sho@@ ddy products so that the survival of the fit@@ test will be advanced .
consumers will be able to shop without having to go far , with comfort and ease of mind , and convenience .
blackberry mobile phones have never been known to wow the crowd with their hardware , but pressure from competition has meant that it has to offer a present@@ able model . hence , the passport was launched last september .

on january 18 , alibaba held an e@@ -@@ commerce poverty eradication summit in chongqing , and announced that it would explore a new “ internet + poverty eradication ” model to help spur measures targeted at erad@@ icating poverty and revitalize the rural economy .
this follows alibaba ’ s rural strategy , launch of the rural taobao program , online rural revitalization and poverty relief platform , as well as the founding of the alibaba poverty relief fund , and is a step@@ -@@ up commitment by alibaba toward combating poverty .
combating and erad@@ icating poverty is presently one of china ’ s key national strategies .
complete eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of china .
“ poverty relief via e@@ -@@ commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development . it is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication .
the central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty , advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication , as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the internet . ”
as such , alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014 , which together with big data cloud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years .
in the same year , alibaba launched the rural taobao program , recruiting “ village partners ” to help lift villagers out of poverty and move toward aff@@ lu@@ ence by way of e@@ -@@ commerce .
in 2017 , alibaba worked together with the ministry of commerce to create a rural revitalization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken counties .
the alibaba platform has incub@@ ated 2@@ 118 taobao villages ,
of which close to 400 have emerged in pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken counties of various provinces , and 33 in 13 pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken provinces .
in 2017 , at alibaba ’ s china retail platform , nationwide sales of taobao villages amounted to r@@ mb@@ 120 billion .
daniel zhang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty , alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology , big data , cloud computing and other innovative competen@@ cies within the alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication .
rural taobao , in particular , is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e@@ -@@ commerce , and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty .
at planting phase , rural taobao and ant financial services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro@@ -@@ loans .
in 2017 , of the 8@@ 32 national@@ -@@ level pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken counties , 7@@ 95 were served by ant financial services , which provided convenient payments , credit and other relevant services .
ca@@ ini@@ ao helped with warehousing and logistics , while tmall was responsible for selling . alibaba cloud ’ s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production , further raising the supply standards , quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce .
the growth in poverty eradication via e@@ -@@ commerce not only requires products , sales channels and industry planning , it also requires talent .
by way of the e@@ -@@ commerce courses conducted by taobao university , alibaba teaches farmers standardized , quality and lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale methods of cultivation , achieving a combination of “ poverty relief + knowledge support ” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable .
these courses have already reached approximately 92 % of national@@ -@@ level pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stricken counties .
the “ philanthro@@ pic mentality , commercial means ” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that alibaba will “ genuinely perform poverty relief ” when carrying out poverty relief activities .
alibaba chairman jack ma once said that erad@@ icating poverty should be divided into three phases - poverty relief , poverty eradication and becoming affluent .
poverty relief is to give someone a fish ; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish ; and becoming affluent is to build a “ fish pond ” for farmers so that farmers can breed fish .
poverty relief through industry development led by e@@ -@@ commerce is building that fish pond .
in terms of poverty relief through industry development , alibaba has part@@ nered luo@@ chuan county in shaanxi province to create a luo@@ chuan apple poverty relief through industry development model , which has been repl@@ icated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments .
alibaba ’ s poverty relief via e@@ -@@ commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers .
e@@ -@@ commerce firms , represented by alibaba , have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and offline channels .
some village partners and ant financial staff have also been invited to the united nations and africa to share their poverty relief via e@@ -@@ commerce experience .
currently , the china office of the united nations world food programme ( w@@ fp ) has already part@@ nered rural taobao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in anhui and other areas .
sina finance news . the “ 3@@ rd new economy think tank summit ” jointly organized by ali research institute and the china vision@@ ary think tank forum was held on january 16 . zhang li , deputy director of the e@@ -@@ commerce research department at the ministry of commerce chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation attended and addressed the summit .
she believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues , i.@@ e@@ . , those related to the essence and form of globalization , as well as issues associated with phases of globalization .
as a result , many believed that globalization has stag@@ nated . moreover , in the new phase , many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern .
the second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermediate phase of globalization . what constra@@ ins the intermediate phase of globalization ?
the reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization .
zhang li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017 . a new growth phase , will begin in 2018 , and growth will be driven by producer goods .
jd ’ s first fresh food supermarket 7@@ fresh officially opened for business recently , and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years .
together with alibaba ’ s he@@ ma supermarket , yon@@ ghui super@@ stores ’ super species , suning ’ s su@@ fresh , me@@ it@@ uan ’ s zhang@@ yu store , and others , “ new retail outlets ” have begun to emerge in clusters , and have even “ challenged ” each other on price in this innovative model .
the fresh food supermarket war has escal@@ ated , and have become a phenomen@@ al topic in the new retail sector . just what is new in new retail ?
“ we will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018 , and will open a large number of stores in beijing , shanghai and hangzhou before the spring festival , ”
he@@ ma supermarket ceo hou yi revealed the company ’ s new approach for 2018 at the 2@@ nd new retail summit on the 10@@ th .
“ with effect from 2018 , he@@ ma will not merely be a fresh produce e@@ -@@ commerce firm ; rather , we will be a general household goods and grocery e@@ -@@ commerce firm that meets consumers ’ requirement for prompt delivery service .
the core model calls for conduction and experience in offline stores , while genuine sales are done online . ”
unlike traditional hyper@@ markets and supermarkets , he@@ ma supermarket is , in the eyes of many consumers , a popular internet store that is fun and has good food . some intermediaries have even come up with the concept of “ he district housing ” ( housing within a 3@@ km radius of a he@@ ma supermarket ) .
both online e@@ -@@ commerce platforms and offline retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses , and consumers are present at various channels . therefore , both parties are attempting the multi@@ -@@ channel model .
industry insiders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading , more “ he@@ ma type ” stores will be opened in 2018 .
meanwhile , he@@ ma has continued to widen its product scope , expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods . this suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year .
“ for instance , the integrated on@@ line@@ -@@ offline business model has attracted consumer eye@@ balls . fresh foods supermarkets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses . ”
“ nonetheless , these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are . at the end of the day , it ’ s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience . only after i have had an experience would i be willing to foot the bill . ”
as far as r@@ t@@ -@@ mart ’ s fe@@ ini@@ u.@@ com ceo yuan bin is concerned , under the new retail environment , consumer habits have changed ; and shopping requirements have changed as well .
originally , there was a clear demar@@ cation between online and offline ; offline wanted to defeat online , and online wanted to counter@@ -@@ attack offline . now , on the other hand , it ’ s become a partnership , because consumers no longer see a difference between online and offline .
capital , competing for a slice of the pie , has made the retail market , represented by fresh food supermarkets , a powder ke@@ g .
analysis shows that at present , new retail competition in tier 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation , and there is still plenty of tier 2 cities yet to be explored . enormous opportunities and potential exist in the market .
new retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth .
cc@@ tv@@ -@@ 2 and the national academy of economic strategy , cass have compiled a stack of dry goods , i.@@ e@@ . , this weigh@@ ty annual report on the development of the e@@ -@@ commerce industry in china .
what sort of report card did china ’ s e@@ -@@ commerce industry receive this year ?
what are the growth trends of the global e@@ -@@ commerce industry ?
let us reveal the results one by one .
total sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track
china ’ s online retail sales have been sky roc@@ keting since 2006 . this may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time . shopping without leaving home ; cool !
since 2013 however , the online retail sales growth rate has deceler@@ ated from more than 50 % to less than 40 % for the first time in 2015 ; in 2016 , the growth rate was 2@@ 6.2 % .
the situation changed this year , however . online retail sales accelerated again . for the first nine months of this year , growth rate rebounded to 3@@ 4.2 % ,
significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016 .
perhaps shoppers took a de@@ tour but eventually realized that retail therapy does wonders for one ’ s mind and body .
in particular , online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately r@@ mb@@ 5.@@ 08 trillion , while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly r@@ mb@@ 1.@@ 49 trillion .
this com@@ prised 13.@@ 6 % of total retail sales of consumer goods , up nearly 3 percentage points year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year .
wake up , students . it ’ s time to highlight the key points . online retail sales of services was definitely a major contributor !
elsewhere , per capita online shopping of french netizens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to us $ 1,@@ 9@@ 25 . goods they purchased online are primarily clothing , worthy of being called a nation of fashion lovers .
who says those who love online shopping most must be young ?
the start@@ -@@ ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next uber
amy er@@ rett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e@@ -@@ commerce start@@ -@@ up , but surveys weren 't working .
responses were often vague , un@@ helpful or , worse , dece@@ it@@ ful .
and even if she promised anonym@@ ity , some workers didn 't trust the process .
" it just never had consistency and objectivity , " said er@@ rett , who runs the 7@@ 5@@ -@@ person san francisco e@@ -@@ commerce hair care company madison reed .
so she called in outsiders for help .
a new breed of human resources start@@ -@@ ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
by building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , they allow companies to do snap polls , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whist@@ le@@ -@@ blow@@ ers to bypass c@@ -@@ suite executives and go straight to the board of directors .
" you 've now got tools such as stra@@ va and fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where 's the fit@@ bit for your company ? " said jim bar@@ nett , co@@ -@@ founder and chief executive of red@@ wood city start@@ -@@ up g@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
er@@ rett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using g@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why .
companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture , lest they become the next uber , which has been en@@ mes@@ hed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished .
for start@@ -@@ ups such as g@@ lin@@ t , this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to finance tech insights website let 's talk payments .
denver , col@@ o . , start@@ -@@ up conver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an up@@ tick in interest and activity earlier this year amid uber 's fall into dis@@ repu@@ te .
conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including air@@ bn@@ b , microsoft , and tesla .
uber recently signed up as a client .
like g@@ lin@@ t , conver@@ cent lets companies send customized " pulse " surveys , gather confidential responses in real time , and view heat maps of its problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is impl@@ icated , complaints go straight to the board of directors .
" the court of public opinion has us@@ ur@@ ped regulators , " said patrick quin@@ lan , the founder and chief executive of conver@@ cent .
if a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave un@@ eth@@ ically , even if regulators don 't step in , it can face costly consequences from consumer boy@@ co@@ t@@ ts , employee at@@ tri@@ tion and lawsuits , quin@@ lan said .
ruby tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations , has used conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters , lodge a formal complaint , and hope it was taken seriously .
it was often an intim@@ id@@ ating and uncomfortable experience , said james vit@@ ran@@ o , ruby tuesday 's general counsel , who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints .
now that the company is using conver@@ cent , though , problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed .
" i can get closer to that holistic , 3@@ 60@@ -@@ degree view into the employment experience , " said vit@@ ran@@ o , who over@@ sees ruby tuesday 's risk management group .
" and we 're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation . "
companies started taking ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm arthur ander@@ sen collapsed because of ethical violations from the en@@ ron scandal , quin@@ lan said .
but it wasn 't until " social media came into its own " that companies realized they couldn 't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online .
" prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .
both g@@ lin@@ t and conver@@ cent offer their software as a service , charging companies recurring fees to use their products .
it 's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , who have pro@@ pped up both start@@ -@@ ups .
conver@@ cent raised $ 10 million in funding in february from firms such as sapphire ventures and tol@@ a capital , bringing its total capital raised to $ 47 million .
g@@ lin@@ t secured $ 10 million in november from bes@@ se@@ mer venture partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments hardly come as a surprise , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there 's a growing body of research showing today 's employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
in competitive markets such as silicon valley , high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes .
employees want to feel that they 're accepted and valued and that they 're giving their time to a company with a positive mission .
" when people are happy to be at a company , feel their voices are heard , and that the work they are doing is rewarding , they are more committed to making that company successful , " said nina mc@@ queen , vice president of global benefits and employee experience at lin@@ ke@@ din , which uses both conver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well ; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged .
if third@@ -@@ party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement , it 's no wonder they 're finding backing .
having data on employee engagement is important , according to workplace culture experts .
but the data are useless unless a company 's custo@@ dians take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees for their feedback , it can set an expectation that change is on the way .
and if change doesn 't come fast enough , or at all , it can breed disappointment and make employees dis@@ engaged .
" if you 're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , " said russell ra@@ ath , president of consulting at business management firm ko@@ tter international , who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection .
" because if you don 't follow through , employees will wonder , ' did you really hear me ?
do you care ?
and if you don 't care , why should i care ? ' "
madison reed , which now does monthly employee surveys , has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on g@@ lin@@ t , according to er@@ rett .
and , after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decis@@ ion@@ -@@ making and the quality of communication , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues .
over at ruby tuesday , the company is getting new insight on its employees , and it 's hoping that in the long run , this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
" if you 're not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you 're going to lose people , " vit@@ ran@@ o said .
" and if you lose people , you 're going to lose customers .
and when you lose customers , you 're going to lose companies . "

the n@@ ca@@ a 's elimination of two@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day practices makes for a long day for the bru@@ ins
it 's pushing 11 p.@@ m. as a thr@@ ong of uc@@ la football players linger to chat on one side of the team 's new on@@ -@@ campus practice fields .
some have peeled off their jersey tops , revealing backs sl@@ ick with sweat from the to@@ il of the first day of training camp .
for a good chunk of the team , these idle minutes constitute a mid@@ day break .
players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dor@@ ms after the three@@ -@@ hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the was@@ ser@@ man football center for meetings at 6 : 30 the following morning .
" this is a grind for these guys the next three days , " bru@@ ins coach jim mor@@ a said not long before monday turned into tuesday .
the n@@ ca@@ a 's elimination of two@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day practices , designed to lighten the load on players , has actually length@@ ened their days - at least until finals end friday .
that 's why uc@@ la 's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7 : 15 p.@@ m. to accommodate players ' already cra@@ mmed schedules .
the trade@@ -@@ off from no two@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ days is more one@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ days , the bru@@ ins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during mor@@ a 's six seasons in west@@ wood .
they are scheduled to hold 18 practices through aug@@ . 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against texas a & m on sept .
mor@@ a said he supported the n@@ ca@@ a 's rule change even if it did add another item to players ' busy itiner@@ aries .
" we 're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it 's very challenging , " mor@@ a said .
" and they 've just pushed through it ; they grind , they 're great kids .
i think once we get to saturday and we 'll have more time , it will really be great . "
uc@@ la will close its practices once camp is finished , no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the ad@@ joining lus@@ kin center , an up@@ scale hotel that has already been pel@@ ted with foot@@ balls that cleared a protective net behind a goal@@ post .
bru@@ ins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend , but mor@@ a acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season .
" we will have security , " mor@@ a said .
" that is a real concern and it 's not far@@ -@@ fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and video@@ tape a practice .
if you have video@@ tape of a practice , it 's a pretty good deal .
but we 'll have security there and we 'll have security up in parking lot 8 .
we 'll do the best we can with what we got .
i 'm not going to worry too much about it .
we have a plan in place . "

facebook to step up fac@@ t@@ -@@ checking in fight against fake news
facebook is to send more potential ho@@ ax articles to third@@ -@@ party fact chec@@ kers and show their findings below the original post , the world 's largest online social network said on thursday as it tries to fight so@@ -@@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible ho@@ axes and send them to fact chec@@ kers , potentially showing fac@@ t@@ -@@ checking results under the original article .
facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so@@ -@@ called fake news , which many think influenced the 2016 u.s. presidential election .
the issue has also become a big political topic in europe , with french voters delu@@ ged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in may and germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful post@@ ings promptly , ahead of elections there in september .
on thursday facebook said in a separate statement in german that a test of the new fac@@ t@@ -@@ checking feature was being launched in the united states , france , the netherlands and germany .

she added that facebook would keep testing its " related article " feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news .
building a graphic novel : a castle in england 's story
in its recent past , the di@@ minu@@ tive scot@@ ney castle has featured in a squeeze music video and been a bol@@ th@@ ole for margaret thatcher during the 197@@ 0@@ s and 198@@ 0@@ s .
but scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of tum@@ ul@@ tuous history from its co@@ sy seat in be@@ wl river valley in kent , now inspiration for a graphic novel written by jamie rho@@ des , a mop@@ -@@ haired yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pen@@ chant for historical documents .
" i find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says wi@@ st@@ fully .
" what a personal connection , to hold that letter in my hand . "
span@@ ning the middle ages to the ed@@ war@@ dian era , a castle in england documents the families that lived in scot@@ ney , with each story illustrated by a different , upcoming uk artist - isaac len@@ kie@@ wic@@ z , bri@@ ony may smith , william ex@@ ley , becky palmer and isabel green@@ berg .
it is not rho@@ des 's first book based on an archive : he also wrote 2014 's dead men 's teeth and other stories , a collection inspired by documents in the british library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .
" i well@@ ed up at just the thum@@ b@@ print on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 17@@ 00@@ s who was working for the jacob@@ ites , " he says .
" that 's his thum@@ b@@ print !
and letters always smell like smoke because , back then , you lit a fire for light .
to someone 300 years in the future , the smell makes it feel like they 're there , too .
ah , i love archives ! "
for someone so sm@@ it@@ ten with old papers , getting support from the national trust and arts council england and living in a castle for almost four months ( " i over@@ stayed my welcome a little bit , to be honest " ) seems too good to be true .
rho@@ des spent his days exploring the victorian " new " castle , going through the archives and studying the manor 's many treasures and curi@@ os , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the mo@@ at .
he wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , talking to rang@@ ers , garden@@ ers and sometimes the artists at work on his book 's illustrations .
then at night , he 'd " drink whiskey and get writing . "
the intimate history of scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the national trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir , elizabeth hus@@ sey , died .
when rho@@ des arrived a decade later , staff were only starting to tackle the archive , which he describes as " hundreds of years of aristoc@@ rats going : ' oh , stick it in the lo@@ ft ' . "
di@@ aries , letters from the days of the english empire , maps out@@ lining who owned what : " you 'd think land disputes would be boring , " says rho@@ des , " but there was this one bir@@ ch tree two families were fighting over .
just let it go , guys ! "
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jum@@ ping@@ -@@ off point to del@@ ve more broadly into english history , including the lab@@ ou@@ rer , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 13@@ 81 peasants ' revol@@ t .
" there is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book called the kni@@ gh@@ tly families of kent and sus@@ sex , " says rho@@ des .
" the peasants ' revol@@ t started in that area and i thought , a riot is a good place to start .
maybe the two are connected ? "

the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned
just when you thought 2017 couldn 't get any weir@@ der along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector .
yep .
sex robots are a big deal right now .
recently , the foundation for responsible robotics ( fr@@ r ) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years .
according to no@@ el shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the university of sh@@ eff@@ i@@ eld and co@@ -@@ founder of the fr@@ r , we need to start taking their rise seriously .
customers can choose the robot 's eye colour , nipple shape and finger@@ nail type .
" people sn@@ ig@@ ger about them , but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more , " mr shar@@ key said at the launch of the new report .
modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow@@ -@@ up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human@@ -@@ like responses achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also " custom@@ ise " their robot to suit their persu@@ as@@ ions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye colour , nipple shape to finger@@ nail type or colour .
but it gets even more disturbing , with many of the robots possessing " personalities " that would make a step@@ ford wife look progressive .
modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin .
the real@@ bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows users to custom@@ ise their robots according to the traits they find appealing , such as shy@@ ness .
then there are the ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold sex robots , developed by true companion , which come with pre@@ -@@ programmed personalities , including " fri@@ g@@ id far@@ rah " that gives the impression of shy@@ ness and " wild wendy " with an " adventur@@ ous " personality .
" ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality , " the true companion website enth@@ uses .
so she likes what you like , dis@@ likes what you dislike , etc .
she also has moo@@ ds during the day just like real people !
she can be sleepy , conversa@@ tional or she can ' be in the mood ' ! "
there are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real , human relationships - but the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent female traits , the ra@@ pe@@ y connotations of making a move on fri@@ g@@ id ( read : resistant ) far@@ rah , are the most concerning .
on its website , true companion lik@@ ened ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy to a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
" if woman ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can 't men have a ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? " the website states .
however , these sex robots are not a mere fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation points to something darker and deeper within our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as an optional ad@@ d@@ -@@ on .
most men , naturally , are not going to keep sex robots , and while the fr@@ r noted their increasing popularity , they remain , for now , on the outskirts of consumer culture .
but what see@@ ps in from the fring@@ es can be highly instruc@@ tive as to the ten@@ or of the era we 're living in .
and many people aren 't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so .
there is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women 's rights are under threat across the globe , when there is a president in the white house who has bra@@ gged about sexually assaul@@ ting women .
the most chilling aspect of the tv series the hand@@ maid 's tale isn 't the graphic imagery , the noo@@ sed bodies and gou@@ ged eyes , but just how realistic that vision feels .
the republic of g@@ ile@@ ad is a leap , but , right now , it doesn 't feel like a large one .
the aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical lik@@ eness to actual women ( albeit with porn star proportions ) as techn@@ ologically possible .
their creators want them to feel human to the touch , for them to mimic the movement of a real body .
but , po@@ inte@@ dly , when it comes to their " personalities " the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot break up with their companion , or walk out .
they have no agency or back@@ -@@ story , nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total serv@@ itude .
they are pleasant slaves , in other words .
or to put it into 2017 parl@@ ance : hand@@ maid@@ ens .

deng chao said , “ i won ’ t do the same thing over and over again in my acting career . i want to renew myself constantly . ”
trump 's great feat ?
making mit@@ t romney seem the epit@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the trump era that the political divisions that have polar@@ ised the us elec@@ tor@@ ate have , on a micro@@ -@@ scale , torn families apart .
around christmas and thanksgiving , newspapers in the us ab@@ ounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of trum@@ p@@ -@@ voting relatives .
we are all supposedly stra@@ ining to burst our filter bubbles .
less re@@ marked on is the power of trump to bring families together .
i mention this because my cousin , a le@@ ft@@ -@@ leaning poet who lives in chicago and who 's long been at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ heads with republicans in our family , has been visiting me in new york this week .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with trump in the white house , everyone she knows , including the republican si@@ bling she had been b@@ ickering with about politics for decades , is suddenly and pecu@@ li@@ arly on the same side .
around the dinner table this is surely a good thing ; but it strikes me that , in a broader context , it carries significant risks .
the left has been invigor@@ ated by trump , but the war@@ ping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all righ@@ tw@@ ards .
when we talk about " normal@@ isation " and trump , we are referring to the scary possibility that his an@@ tics may one day cease to ap@@ pal .
there is an even scar@@ ier long@@ -@@ range scenario , however , in which what trump " normal@@ ises " are righ@@ tw@@ ing republicans who , held up against his standards , suddenly seem the epit@@ ome of reasonable .
i find myself actively nostalg@@ ic these days for mit@@ t romney 's qu@@ ain@@ t version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) - both of which , compared to trump , seem very mild offences indeed .
when trump goes , the next republican candidate will merely have to be san@@ e to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
while my cousin was in town , we took our kids to the car@@ ou@@ sel in central park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels run by the new york parks department , and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don 't require caffeine .
the horses are thunder@@ ously huge , the fi@@ bre@@ -@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all gur@@ ning clo@@ wns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister , and the tin@@ kling music od@@ dly transporting .
so many of the cli@@ ches of a city disappoint : views from tall buildings get old , sky@@ lines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill , and the reality of the city doesn 't live up to the dream .
thir@@ ty@@ -@@ five years later and i 'm still not entirely over the day i discovered swiss cottage is not , in fact , a swiss cottage - the theme pub , ye ol@@ de swiss cottage , doesn 't count - but a large round@@ about in north london .
the central park car@@ ou@@ sel , however , is still a weir@@ dly magical experience , to the extent that two two@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds , an 11@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old and two women in their 40@@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if i could have rated the car@@ ou@@ sel i would have given it full marks , but thank@@ fully nobody asked .
in a department store this week , on the other hand , i was required , before swi@@ ping my credit card , to rate my trans@@ ac@@ tional " experience " on a scale of one to five stars .
in the coffee shop at the corner of my street it 's the same thing , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this for buying something over the counter .
the effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange , but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood gr@@ inning apolog@@ e@@ tically while , we@@ arily , i gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars .
oscar pist@@ ori@@ us taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
this is the second time pist@@ ori@@ us has left jail for a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his w@@ rists , which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell .
pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial man@@ slaughter verdict .
he killed ste@@ en@@ k@@ amp in the early hours of valentine 's day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cu@@ bic@@ le door at his pre@@ toria home .
pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he mi@@ st@@ ook his girlfriend for a night@@ time in@@ truder hiding in the cu@@ bic@@ le .
prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again , this time against pist@@ ori@@ us ' six@@ -@@ year sentence , which they say is too len@@ ient .
the national prosecu@@ ting authority said it will appeal to south africa 's supreme court , and the appeal could be heard this year .
pist@@ ori@@ us faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .

two bul@@ g@@ arians were detained for illegal camping in greece
two bul@@ g@@ arians were detained for illegal camping in greece , the foreign affairs ministry announced , quoted by b@@ tv .
a group of illegally camping people , including the two bul@@ g@@ arians , was detained by the police in si@@ th@@ onia in the morning of august 1 .
the same day they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
the ministry of foreign affairs reported b@@ tv that bul@@ g@@ arians were later released .
the greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose .
checks will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
on may 18 , the ministry of finance issued the “ administrative measures for special rewards and subsidies for the structural adjustments of industrial enterprises ” , and will arrange special rewards and subsidies amoun@@ ting to a total of r@@ mb@@ 100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries .
recently , many local governments including that of shanghai , shanxi , shandong , jiangsu and heilongjiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity .
in particular , many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the central government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces .
one proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90 % of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide .
at an interview with reporters , lin bo@@ qiang , dean of china institute for studies in energy policy at xiamen university , believed that merely relying on the central government ’ s r@@ mb@@ 100 billion to “ reduce overcapacity ” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient . more funds should come from local governments and enterprises . how should that be done ?
in the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by shanxi province , it was proposed that shanxi coking coal group should be restruc@@ tured and transformed into a state@@ -@@ owned capital investment company , its assets and businesses should be reorganized and consolidated , and a new business model constructed .
the actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy . earlier , yin weimin , minister of human resources and social security , said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry were required to be re@@ settled as a result of “ reducing overcapacity ” .
nan@@ fang daily news ( reporter / xie qingyu ) the reporter learned from the provincial environmental protection office today that the 2012 results of the environmental protection credit rating of key sources of pollution are being published .

of the enterprises that would be rated with a red card , heavy pollu@@ ters such as those involved in electroplating , printing and dyeing , and prevention and control dominate . a number of waste water treatment plants were also listed .
the provincial environmental protection office said that in order to reflect the principles of openness , im@@ parti@@ ality and fairness , it welcomes public supervision , and has publicly released the rating results on the website of the environmental protection office .
during the period when the results were publicly released , the environmental protection office received phone calls , letters , visits and many other forms of feedback from the public concerning such issues , which will be investigated , verified and dealt with by the environmental protection office .

but a new study claims quite the opposite : a diet rich in meat@@ -@@ based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of suff@@ e@@ rers of inflammatory bowel disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects around 1.3 million in the us and 300,000 in the uk , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suff@@ e@@ rers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soo@@ the their symptoms , researchers at washington university found protein 's essential amino acid tryp@@ top@@ han helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut .
lead investigator dr marco colon@@ na explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don 't sneak into the body .
cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance , protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
when the balance til@@ ts too far toward inflammation , inflammatory bowel disease can result .
in experiments it was found a kind of toler@@ ance@@ -@@ promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts .
and the bacterium needs tryp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells ' appearance .
professor colon@@ na said : ' we established a link between one bacterial species - lac@@ tobac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tryp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their diet , the more of these immune cells they had . '
he suggested if the same works in humans , a combination of l@@ . reu@@ ter@@ i and a tryp@@ top@@ han@@ -@@ rich diet may foster a more tolerant , less inflammatory gut environment .
post@@ doctoral researcher dr lu@@ isa cer@@ van@@ tes@@ -@@ bar@@ ra@@ gan@@ was studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but hou@@ sed separately did not .
she suspected the difference had to do with the mice 's gut micro@@ biom@@ es - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract .
the guts of the mice were dna sequ@@ enced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them .
mice rea@@ red in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given l@@ . reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells arose .
to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers grew l@@ . reu@@ ter@@ i in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ance@@ -@@ promoting cells .
when the active component was purified from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tryp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as in@@ dol@@ e@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ lactic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tryp@@ top@@ han in the mice 's feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
dr cer@@ van@@ tes@@ -@@ bar@@ ra@@ gan explained people have the same toler@@ ance@@ -@@ promoting cells as mice , and most of us shelter l@@ . reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastrointestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tryp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from l@@ . reu@@ ter@@ i induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice , but defects in genes related to tryp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .
she said : ' the development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines .
potentially , high levels of tryp@@ top@@ han in the presence of l@@ . reu@@ ter@@ i may induce expansion of this population . '
jose mourinho thinks manchester united have signed a ' genius ' in ne@@ man@@ ja matic
manchester united have signed a " genius " in ne@@ man@@ ja matic , believes jose mourinho , after the midfielder made his debut against sam@@ p@@ dor@@ ia on wednesday evening .
the £ 40@@ m signing from chelsea started the 2@@ -@@ 1 win in dublin , united 's final pre@@ season game before the u@@ ef@@ a super cup against real madrid on tuesday , and impressed in the holding role as the likes of paul po@@ g@@ ba and andre@@ as pere@@ ira mar@@ au@@ ded forward at will .
however , having been left out of the blues ' pre@@ season tour of asia , matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes , something mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the premier league season .
" he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " mourinho said .
" we will help him to be ready sooner rather than later . "
as well as matic , fellow new sign@@ ings victor lin@@ del@@ of and ro@@ mel@@ u lu@@ ka@@ ku also started the game at the avi@@ va stadium as mourinho started to shape his starting xi for the start of the season .
the independent revealed this week that mourinho still wanted another three sign@@ ings but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " of delivering three of his four priority sign@@ ings .
" to get three out of four i thank the club for that , " he added .
" i will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me . "
the global spree of fri@@ gates building if china does not build this type of warships , will it fall behind ?
with the recent announcement of the construction of new types of fri@@ gates by major naval powers in the world , it seems that fri@@ gates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight . first , japan has decided to purchase two new fri@@ gates in the 2018 annual defense budget , finally making a substantial breakthrough for its dex fri@@ gates program . later , lock@@ heed martin of usa recently published the latest arrangement for the united states ff@@ g fri@@ gates program . how about china 's plan for building new type of fri@@ gates ?
with the launching of the latest model of 05@@ 4@@ a frigate at the end of 2017 , the number of 05@@ 4@@ a frigate has reached 29 , approaching the sum of the 05@@ 3@@ h series fri@@ gates . since the first 05@@ 4@@ a was launched in 2006 , the history of building 05@@ 4@@ a has extended to 12 years . building such a large number of high@@ -@@ performance general purpose fri@@ gates is very rare in the history . apart from china , the only comparable accomplishment was made by the united states in the 197@@ 0@@ s and 198@@ 0@@ s when it built a host of ' perry ' class fri@@ gates .
and the reason why it is necessary to build so many 05@@ 4@@ a fri@@ gates is simple , that is , it is affordable , easy to operate , and doing so can make up for the deficiency of chinese na@@ vel that has bes@@ et the naval for many years .
the 05@@ 4@@ a frigate has been favored by the chinese navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness . with a displacement of 4,000 tons , the warship is equipped with a 7@@ 6@@ -@@ mm main gun , and shared launching system for 32 h@@ q@@ -@@ 16 and fish@@ -@@ 8 anti@@ -@@ submarine missiles , 8 y@@ j@@ -@@ 83 anti@@ -@@ ship missiles and 1 z@@ -@@ 9 helicopter . although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier , its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today 's standard . it can be ranked as medi@@ um@@ - to high level frigate among all the fri@@ gates in the world .
however , it is a warship designed at the beginning of the 2@@ 1@@ st century after all . arma@@ ments aside , its propulsion system and electronic radar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream fri@@ gates in the world . considering that similar fri@@ gates in europe have been equipped with full electric propulsion , small multi@@ -@@ function phased array rad@@ ars and large helicopter dec@@ ks , it is time to develop new models .
then how should china develop its new fri@@ gates ? this has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of chinese navy .
the future development of the chinese navy will inevitably aim at becoming the blue water navy , roaming in the v@@ ast@@ ness of the oceans . it should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to china ’ s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force . if necessary , it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that china ’ s vital interests in the region are not compromised . so , it seems that the new models of fri@@ gates will surely be huge ships that can ro@@ am the blue water .
let 's look at the positioning of the new fri@@ gates in the future rank and file of chinese navy . the future chinese navy should be similar to the us navy . in addition to the necessary offshore defense ships , the other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious attack group as the situation requires .
the new fri@@ gates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should play the primary role in anti@@ -@@ submarine and short@@ -@@ range air defense operations . in the amphibious attack group , they should provide protection to ships . according to these requirements , the new fri@@ gates must have strong anti@@ -@@ submarine capability and good mid@@ -@@ range air defense capability .
based on the above positioning , we can boldly imagine the rough appearance of the new fri@@ gates in the future .
first , the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 05@@ 4@@ a model . it is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5@@ 000@@ -@@ 6000 tons . the ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a q@@ c@@ 280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines , improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range . as for the weap@@ onry , the 7@@ 6@@ mm main gun and 1@@ 130 near@@ -@@ range anti@@ -@@ aircraft gun will be retained , but a h@@ q@@ -@@ 10 launch system will be added . a shared vertical launching system for 3@@ 2@@ -@@ 48 unit h@@ q@@ -@@ 16 modified missile and fish@@ -@@ 8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun . a large 8@@ -@@ 16@@ -@@ unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ rear section of the hull for the launch of y@@ j@@ -@@ 18 and new cruise missiles . hang@@ ars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10@@ -@@ ton helicopters . as for the electronic radar systems , the high grade model will be equipped with a small four@@ -@@ sided fixed phas@@ e@@ -@@ control array radar developed based on 34@@ 6@@ a. the low grade model will be furnished with multi@@ -@@ function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on european fri@@ gates .
thus , the overall level of the new fri@@ gates will edge into the world 's top bracket , even comparable to the ff@@ g fri@@ gates of the usa .
of course , these are only the author 's conjec@@ ture on domestically produced new fri@@ gates . only when the new fri@@ gates are launched into the water can we know the truth . let 's anticipate the day .

in the present situation where actors taking on roles in several dramas simultaneously is popular , lead actors and actresses would be at different sets at the same time . this has meant that they would not be able to appear at the same set at the same time . as such , film crews have been forced to use doubles to ensure the film schedule .

china 's household debt ratio is close to the united states . is being unable to repay loan more frightening than being unable to afford a home ?
recently , everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies . is it true that real estate policies have been loosen@@ ed ? is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices ?
however , just when we were worried about real estate prices , macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market , the people 's daily published an important commentary once again . last time we discussed how people ’ s daily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary . this time , the commentary of people 's daily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affor@@ dability of housing : can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage ?
today , let 's discuss the question more serious than buying a house : repay the loan .
i. china 's growing housing debt crisis
the people 's daily overseas edition published a commentary titled “ awards and loans : the joy and worries of struggling young people ” on january 17@@ th . the article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial del@@ ever@@ aging in the 3@@ r@@ th quarter jointly published by the national laboratory of finance and development of the chinese academy of social sciences and the national balance sheet research center in november 2017 . according to the report , the leverage ratio of the residents ' sector continues to climb , rising from 4@@ 7.4 % in the second quarter of 2017 to 4@@ 8.6 % in the third quarter , an increase of 1.3 % , which amounts to an increase of 3.8 % in the first three quarters of 2017 .
the residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy , and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly .
relevant studies have shown that chinese households ' debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans , which account for about two@@ -@@ thirds of residents ' debts , which is about twice that of business loans .
among the consumer loans , medi@@ um@@ - and long@@ -@@ term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80 % , but short@@ -@@ term consumer loans grow faster than medi@@ um@@ - and long@@ -@@ term loans .
moreover , the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions . in fact , many chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends , creating a large amount invisible loans .
seeing such data , one cannot help but be stu@@ pe@@ fied . according to the statistical data of suning financial research institute , the leverage ratio of chinese households was only 3 % in 1996 and 18 % in 2008 . but this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in , reaching 3@@ 6.4 % . by the third quarter of 2017 , the leverage ratio of households has reached 4@@ 8.6 % .
let 's make another comparison . in may last year , hsbc issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries .
the investigation was targeted at young people in the mill@@ ennial generation ( born between 1980 and 2000 ) in nine countries .
the report pointed out that china 's young people who were born in 198@@ 0@@ s and 199@@ 0@@ s have a home ownership rate of 70 % , far ahead of mexico at the second place ( 46 % ) , and twice the us level ( 35 % ) .
these figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes , the biggest risk of ' grey rhin@@ oc@@ eros ' for chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt .
2 . why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem ?
as we have analyzed previously , although we have been saying that china ’ s housing prices are relatively high , china ’ s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world . so the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can re@@ play the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home .
a quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that china ’ s real estate market hasn 't experience major crisis except for the localized crisis in hainan province as we mentioned before . this is because commercialization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in china . however , it 's alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the united states triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008 , just a decade ago .
the blame for the real estate crisis in the united states falls on two financial institutions : f@@ annie mae and freddie mac .
in the so called ' golden age ' of the united states , real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low@@ -@@ income people in order to expand sales . when the us economy was prosperous , the real estate market was also thriving . however , it did not last long . the stagnation of growth in the u.s. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall , which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline .
most u.s. families had both financial assets and real estate assets . at that time , almost all household assets of the low@@ -@@ income families were real e@@ states , while the majority assets of the top 20 % high@@ -@@ income families were financial assets . as a result , poorer people in the united states have higher debt ratio .
a grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous , so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income . when the income declined , the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans . thus , the real estate problems of these american families gradually evolved into a real estate crises .
some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low . the banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaul@@ ted on the loan , and then sold them at very low prices , resulting in a step@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ step price fall in the area . this vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices . when the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent , more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans . thus , more and more people stopped re@@ paying their home mortgages , resulting in a large number of bad debts .
in this way , a huge vicious circle formed :
“ economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can ’ t repay mortgages – banks sell defaul@@ ted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ... "
the problem did not stop there . as house prices continue to fall , a new situation emerged : the money the bank got after auc@@ tioning the defaul@@ ted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank , the home buyer still need to repay the loan . so stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt . for example , if you paid a down payment of $ 600,000 and borrowed $ 2.4 million to buy a house worth $ 3 million at the time . when the house price falls to $ 2 million , you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank . after the bank auctions the house , you will not only lost your down payment of $ 600,000 , but also owed $ 400,000 debts to the bank . you still have to repay the debt .
thus , with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another , the u.s. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the u.s. financial crisis in 2008 .
therefore , the fact that china ’ s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 4@@ 6.8 % is a problem that requires great vigilance . although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present , the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge . the central government started to stress the issue of del@@ ever@@ aging repeatedly in the last year , which is a very pres@@ ci@@ ent judgment . if the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb , it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis . therefore , we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks .
it 's no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market : houses are for living , not for speculation . the government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks , including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house renting .
for our individual families , we must abandon the mindset of specul@@ ating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities . in this way , we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden . a reasonable assessment of one 's own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth .

white house prop cost taxpayers thousands
the white house 's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the south lawn for an event highlighting american manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $ 2@@ 4,000 , according to military records released to time .
the green@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ h@@ -@@ 3@@ d , known as marine one when the president is aboard , was the center@@ piece of the july 17 event at the white house show@@ casing american construction programs .
president donald trump , vice president mike pence and senior white house officials tou@@ red manufacturing products from all 50 states .
the connectic@@ ut@@ -@@ made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from maine , a fire truck from wisconsin , and a forklift from mississippi .
the white house military office requested the helicopter 's presence in a frag@@ mentary order , or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn for the " unusual " event , according to the records of marine helicopter squadron one ( h@@ m@@ x@@ -@@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .
" i just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it 's such an unusual high visibility event , " the commander of h@@ m@@ x@@ -@@ 1 e@@ mailed his superior , the marine deputy comman@@ dant for aviation , the day before the event .
the message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn at approximately 7 a.@@ m. on july 17 for the 3 p.@@ m. event , and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.@@ m. and 9 p.@@ m. that evening .
the note adds that should the departure from the white house be delayed , a second air@@ crew would be needed for the return flight due to du@@ ty@@ -@@ hour restrictions .
the original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event , while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground .
it was not clear from records provided to time whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the hatch act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes .
records indicate that h@@ m@@ x@@ -@@ 1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision .
" one question we asked was if it was a violation of the hatch act and were informed it was not , " the commander wrote .
" sounds like you are locked , " the deputy comman@@ dant replied .
the " made in america " event was designated an official event by the white house , and would not have been covered by the hatch act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the senate and tou@@ ted efforts to rein in government regulations .
using the aircraft known as marine one or air force one for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
presidents are required to use them for travel .
but requ@@ isi@@ tioning their use solely for a photo@@ -@@ op is unusual .
trump drew scrutiny in february when the presidential airplane ta@@ xi@@ ed to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in melbourne , fl@@ a . , and his twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor 's use of the presidential aircraft .
" the white house is thrilled with the ' made in america ' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by american workers with american materials , " said white house deputy press secretary lindsay wal@@ ters .
h@@ m@@ x@@ -@@ 1 crews frequently perform training flights around the washington area and at the south lawn to practice depos@@ iting the president of the united states at the white house with inches of precision .
when trump was at the g@@ -@@ 20 summit in germany in early july , h@@ m@@ x@@ -@@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings at the white house .
the flight for the made in america event counted toward the air@@ crew 's training requirement for the month , an official said .
unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for " non@@ -@@ presidential support missions . "
the white house said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event .
a spokesperson for si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the south lawn .
h@@ m@@ x@@ -@@ 1 doesn 't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights , and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult .
but according to department of defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017 , the do@@ d reimbursement rate for the v@@ h@@ -@@ 3@@ d is $ 24,@@ 380 per flight hour .
unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at marine corps air facility quan@@ tico in virginia .
the white house argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .
" to place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading , " wal@@ ters said .
" these rate estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropri@@ ations . "
according to a 2015 rand study , do@@ d reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel , but do account for fuel , maintenance , and contracting costs .
at the time , former white house press secretary sean spic@@ er defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
" the idea is to showcase this week things that are made in america , " spic@@ er said .
" and i know si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security , that there are , i assume , hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that .
and i think , like most americans , we 're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly to do .
so , of course , it 's appropriate to highlight that . "
it wasn 't clear whether trump inter@@ acted with the helicopter as he tou@@ red the south lawn for the event , but he did step into the driver 's seat of a fire truck .
inside the white house , trump addressed si@@ kor@@ sky representatives , joking with the media about his own fleet of company products .
" i know si@@ kor@@ sky very well , " the president said , " i have three of them . "
brilliant metaph@@ ors of xi jinping about comprehensively strengthening party discipline
during the second plenary session of the 19@@ th central commission for discipline inspection of the communist party of china , general secretary xi jinping gave a keynote speech on january 11 , emphasizing that “ we should keep marching ahead on the road of adhering to the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline and creating a new situation for comprehensively strengthening party discipline ” .
with respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline , general secretary xi jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaph@@ ors , so let ’ s review them together !

neighbors also said that flowers blooming on the money tree is a rare sight . residents of the housing estate felt that this was very auspicious , and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter .
the scientific name for the money tree is “ mal@@ ab@@ ar chestnut ” , a tropical plant native to mexico . it performs best in warm and damp conditions , and its flowers will only bloom under appropriate conditions such as sunlight , water and nutri@@ ments .
even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate , flowers blooming on money trees are rare . it was once said that the “ chance of flowers blooming is one in a thousand ” .
yesterday morning , reporters visited the nanning machinery office dormitory at min@@ zhu road . led by aunt gao , the reporters saw the money tree .
planted amid the flower bed of the housing estate , the money tree was about five meters tall , and the branch circumference , at its thick@@ est , measured approximately 30 cm . its leaves were emerald green and luxur@@ i@@ ant .

shichang xing@@ bao reported that between 2005 and 2011 , the gdp of anhui province rose from joint “ bottom ” to second at one stroke .
however , the province ’ s economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency , and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy . to this end , the latest issue of the “ economic blue paper ” of the province ’ s economic information center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth .
we have made a comparison of some of the representative indices of the province ’ s economy between 2005 and 2011 with that of the nation and central china .
in 2011 , in terms of industrial economic benefit , high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials , which com@@ prised a relatively large proportion of the province , had to endure “ twin pressures ” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity . at the same time , home appliances , automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation , resulting in slim profits .
meanwhile , enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit , which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth .
as regards this , experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incen@@ ti@@ vi@@ ze enterprises to innovate . the technical outcomes of institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “ transferred ” to enterprises .
as for low industrial economic benefit , experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced , industry structure optimized , and the industry chain extended .

g@@ mb scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the tol@@ l@@ cross site .
more than 500 people work at the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea biscuits , among other products .
mc@@ vi@@ tie 's owner pl@@ ad@@ is said it had invested more than £ 5@@ m at the site in the last few years .
it added employees and union representatives " will be the first to know " if there were any changes to its operations .
in a letter to the company 's site manager , g@@ mb scotland called on mc@@ vi@@ tie 's to " address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modern@@ isation of production lines . "
g@@ mb senior organ@@ iser drew du@@ ffy , said : " the fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of tol@@ l@@ cross is deeply concerning our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater glas@@ gow area , a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .
so , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the backdrop of brexit , rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline , the east end of glas@@ gow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at mc@@ vi@@ tie 's . "
a spokeswoman for pl@@ ad@@ is said : " the site manager at tol@@ l@@ cross received a letter from g@@ mb scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and g@@ mb representatives at tol@@ l@@ cross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly .
we discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive .
she added : " in recent years , we have invested over £ 5@@ m in our tol@@ l@@ cross site , notably on production lines and operational improvements .
we fully recognise the heritage of tol@@ l@@ cross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . "

wel@@ sh ams worried about ' looking like m@@ up@@ pe@@ ts@@ '
there is con@@ ster@@ nation among some ams at a suggestion their title should change to m@@ w@@ ps ( member of the wel@@ sh parliament ) .
it has ar@@ isen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the wel@@ sh parliament .
ams across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule .
one labour am said his group was concerned " it rhy@@ mes with tw@@ p and pw@@ p . "
for readers outside of wales : in wel@@ sh tw@@ p means daf@@ t and pw@@ p means poo .
a pla@@ id am said the group as a whole was " not happy " and has suggested alternatives .
a wel@@ sh conservative said his group was " open minded " about the name change , but noted it was a short verbal hop from m@@ wp to mu@@ pp@@ et .
in this context the wel@@ sh letter w is pronounced similarly to the yor@@ kshire english pronunciation of the letter u .
the assembly commission , which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes , said : " the final decision on any descrip@@ tors of what assembly members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves . "
the government of wales act 2017 gave the wel@@ sh assembly the power to change its name .
in june , the commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a wel@@ sh parliament .
on the matter of the ams ' title , the commission fav@@ oured wel@@ sh parliament members or w@@ mps , but the m@@ wp option received the most support in a public consultation .
ams are apparently suggesting alternative options , but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer , elin jones , who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks .
the legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works , including rules on dis@@ qualification of ams and the design of the committee system .
ams will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation .
maced@@ oni@@ ans go to polls in referendum on changing country 's name
voters will vote sunday on whether to change their country 's name to the " republic of north macedonia . "
the popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decad@@ es@@ -@@ long dispute with neighboring greece , which has its own province called macedonia .
athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor 's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the eu and nato .
maced@@ onian president g@@ jor@@ ge ivan@@ ov , an opponent of the ple@@ bis@@ cite on the name change , has said he will disregard the vote .
however , supporters of the referendum , including prime minister z@@ or@@ an za@@ ev , argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the eu and nato .
the bells of st@@ . martin 's fall silent as churches in har@@ lem struggle
" historically , the old people i 've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner , " mr. adams said .
" today , there 's neither . "
he said the disappearance of bars was understandable .
" people soci@@ alize in a different way " nowadays , he said .
" bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis . "
as for churches , he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to , " and sooner or later they 'll be right back where they started . "
churches , he added , could be replaced by apartment buildings with con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood 's remaining sanc@@ tu@@ aries .
" the overwhelming majority of people who buy con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums in these buildings will be white , " he said , " and therefore will has@@ ten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums will become members of these churches . "
both churches were built by white con@@ gre@@ gations before har@@ lem became a black metropolis - metropolitan community in 18@@ 70 , st@@ . martin 's a decade later .
the original white metho@@ dist congregation moved out in the 19@@ 30@@ s .
a black congregation that had been wor@@ shi@@ ping nearby took title to the building .
st@@ . martin 's was taken over by a black congregation under the rev@@ . john howard johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on 12@@ 5@@ th street , a main street for shopping in har@@ lem , who resisted hiring or promoting blacks .
a fire in 19@@ 39 left the building badly damaged , but as father johnson 's par@@ ishi@@ on@@ ers made plans to rebuild , they commissioned the car@@ ill@@ on .
the rev@@ . david johnson , father johnson 's son and successor at st@@ . martin 's , proudly called the car@@ ill@@ on " the poor people 's bells . "
the expert who played the car@@ ill@@ on in july called it something else : " a cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument . "
the expert , tiffany ng of the university of michigan , also noted that it was the first car@@ ill@@ on in the world to be played by a black musician , di@@ on@@ is@@ io a. l@@ ind , who moved to the larger car@@ ill@@ on at the riverside church 18 years ago .
mr. mer@@ ri@@ weather said that st@@ . martin 's did not replace him .
what has played out at st@@ . martin 's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors , some brought in by the lay leaders of the church , others by the epis@@ cop@@ al di@@ oc@@ ese .
the ve@@ stry - the par@@ ish 's governing body , made up of lay leaders - wrote the di@@ oc@@ ese in july with concerns that the di@@ oc@@ ese " would seek to pass along the costs " to the ve@@ stry , even though the ve@@ stry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the di@@ oc@@ ese sent in .
some par@@ ishi@@ on@@ ers complained of a lack of transparency on the di@@ oc@@ ese 's part .
shark inju@@ res 13@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old on lobster dive in california
a shark attacked and injured a 13@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old boy saturday while he was diving for lobster in california on the opening day of lobster season , officials said .
the attack occurred just before 7 a.@@ m. near beacon 's beach in enc@@ in@@ it@@ as .
chad ham@@ mel told k@@ sw@@ b@@ -@@ tv in san diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then pad@@ dled over with a group to help pull him out of the water .
ham@@ mel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster , but then he " realized that he was yelling , ' i got bit !
i got bit ! '
his whole cla@@ vic@@ le was ripped open , " ham@@ mel said he noticed once he got to the boy .
" i yelled at everyone to get out of the water : ' there 's a shark in the water ! ' " ham@@ mel added .
the boy was air@@ lifted to ra@@ dy children 's hospital in san diego where he is listed in critical condition .
the species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown .
life@@ guard cap@@ t@@ . larry gil@@ es said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier , but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark .
gil@@ es added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper tor@@ so area .
officials shut down beach access from pon@@ to beach in cas@@ ab@@ lad to sw@@ ami 's in ec@@ in@@ it@@ as for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes .
gil@@ es noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area , but most are not considered dangerous .
sa@@ ins@@ bury 's plans push into uk beauty market
sa@@ ins@@ bury 's is taking on boots , super@@ drug and de@@ ben@@ ha@@ ms with department store@@ -@@ style beauty ais@@ les sta@@ ffed with specialist assistants .
as part of a substantial push into the uk 's £ 2.@@ 8@@ bn beauty market , which is continuing to grow while fashion and home@@ ware sales fall back , the larger beauty ais@@ les will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success .
the investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for tvs , micro@@ waves and home@@ ware .
sa@@ ins@@ bury 's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products , including brands such as rev@@ lon , essie , twee@@ zer@@ man and dr. pa@@ w@@ paw for the first time .
existing ranges from l '@@ o@@ real , may@@ bel@@ line and bur@@ t 's bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like boots .
the supermarket is also rela@@ un@@ ching its boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are ve@@ gan@@ -@@ friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers .
in addition , perfume retailer the fragrance shop will be testing out concessions in two sa@@ ins@@ bury 's stores , the first of which opened in cro@@ y@@ don , south london , last week while a second opens in sel@@ ly oak , birmingham , later this year .
online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit .
mike coupe , the chief executive of sa@@ ins@@ bury 's , has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the dis@@ counters al@@ di and li@@ dl with more services and non@@ -@@ food .
sa@@ ins@@ bury 's has been putting ar@@ gos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which it says has bol@@ ste@@ red grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .
the supermarket 's previous attempt to rev@@ amp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure .
sa@@ ins@@ bury 's tested a joint venture with boots in the early 200@@ 0@@ s , but the tie@@ -@@ up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist 's stores in its supermarkets .
the new strategy comes after sa@@ ins@@ bury 's sold its 28@@ 1@@ -@@ store pharmacy business to cel@@ es@@ io , the owner of the lloy@@ ds pharmacy chain , for £ 12@@ 5@@ m , three years ago .
it said lloy@@ ds would play a role in the plan , by adding an extended range of luxury skin@@ care brands including la ro@@ che@@ -@@ po@@ say and vi@@ chy in four stores .
paul mill@@ s@@ -@@ hic@@ ks , sa@@ ins@@ bury 's commercial director , said : " we 've transformed the look and feel of our beauty ais@@ les to enhance the environment for our customers .
we 've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice .
our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the all@@ uring environment and convenient locations mean we 're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping . "
peter jones ' furious ' after holly will@@ ough@@ by pulls out of £ 11@@ million deal
dragons den star peter jones left ' furious ' after tv pres@@ enter holly will@@ ough@@ by pulls out of £ 11@@ million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with marks and spencer and it@@ v
will@@ ough@@ by has no time for their home@@ wear and accessories brand truly .
the pair 's business had been lik@@ ened to g@@ wy@@ ne@@ th pal@@ tro@@ w 's goo@@ p brand .
this morning pres@@ enter , 37 , took to instagram to announce she is leaving .
holly will@@ ough@@ by has left dragons " den star peter jones fum@@ ing by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with marks & spencer and it@@ v .
sources say jones was " furious " when tv 's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in mar@@ low , buc@@ king@@ ham@@ shire , that her new deals - worth up to £ 1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their home@@ wear and accessories brand truly .
the business had been lik@@ ened to g@@ wy@@ ne@@ th pal@@ tro@@ w 's goo@@ p brand and was tipped to double will@@ ough@@ by 's estimated £ 11 million fortune .
as will@@ ough@@ by , 37 , took to instagram to announce she was leaving truly , jones jet@@ ted out of britain to head for one of his holiday homes .
a source said : " truly was by far the top of holly 's priorities .
it was going to be her long@@ -@@ term future that would see her through the next couple of decades .
her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned .
nobody could believe what was happening on tuesday , it was so close to the launch .
there is a warehouse full of goods at the mar@@ low h@@ q which are ready to be sold . "
experts believe the departure of the this morning pres@@ enter , who is among britain 's most bank@@ able stars , could cost the firm millions due to he@@ fty investment in products ranging from cushi@@ ons and candles to clothing and home@@ wear , and the potential for further delays to its launch .
and it could mean the end of a long friendship .
mother@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ three will@@ ough@@ by and husband dan bal@@ d@@ win have been close to jones and his wife tara cap@@ p for ten years .
will@@ ough@@ by set up truly with cap@@ p in 2016 and jones , 52 , joined as chairman in march .
the couples holiday together and jones has a 40 per cent stake in bal@@ d@@ win 's tv production firm .
will@@ ough@@ by is to become a brand ambassador for m & s and will replace ant mc@@ part@@ lin as host of it@@ v 's i 'm a celebrity .
a source close to jones said last night " we wouldn 't comment on his business affairs . "
tough talk ' and then we fell in love@@ '
he joked about criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment some would consider " un@@ presidential " and for being so positive about the north korean leader .
why has president trump given up so much ?
trump said in his mock " news anchor " voice .
" i didn 't give up anything . "
he noted that kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in singapore in june was hailed by trump as a big step toward denuclearization of north korea .
but denuclearization negotiations have stalled .
more than three months after the june summit in singapore , north korea 's top diplomat ri yong ho told world leaders at the u.@@ n@@ . general assembly saturday that the north doesn 't see a " corresponding response " from the u.s. to north korea 's early disarmament moves .
instead , he noted , the u.s. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure .
trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech .
" we 're doing great with north korea , " he said .
" we were going to war with north korea .
millions of people would have been killed .
now we have this great relationship . "
he said his efforts to improve relations with kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests , helping free hostages and getting the remains of american servic@@ emen returned home .
and he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with kim .
" it 's so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena , we 'd have about 200 people standing right there , " trump said , pointing at the crowd directly in front of him .
indonesia tsunami and quake deva@@ state an island , killing hundreds
in the aftermath of the lom@@ bo@@ k earthquake , for instance , foreign non@@ governmental organizations were told they were not needed .
even though more than 10 percent of lom@@ bo@@ k 's population had been dis@@ located , no national disaster was declared , a prerequisite for cataly@@ zing international aid .
" in many cases , unfortunately , they 've been very clear that they 're not requesting international assistance , so it 's a bit challenging , " ms. sum@@ bun@@ g said .
while save the children is putting together a team to travel to pal@@ u , it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground .
mr. su@@ top@@ o , the national disaster agency spokesman , said indonesian officials were assessing the situation in pal@@ u to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort .
given the earth shaking that indonesia constantly en@@ dures , the country remains wo@@ e@@ fully under@@ prepared for nature 's wrath .
while tsunami shelters have been built in ace@@ h , they are not a common sight on other coast@@ lines .
the apparent lack of a tsunami warning si@@ ren in pal@@ u , even though a warning had been in effect , is likely to have contributed to the loss of life .
at the best of times , traveling between indonesia 's many islands is challenging .
natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .
a hospital ship that had been stationed in lom@@ bo@@ k to treat earthquake victims is making its way to pal@@ u , but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity .
president jo@@ ko wido@@ do made improving indonesia 's tat@@ tered infrastructure a center@@ piece of his election campaign , and he has la@@ vis@@ hed money on roads and railways .
but funding short@@ falls have plagued mr. jo@@ ko 's administration as he faces re@@ -@@ election next year .
mr. jo@@ ko is also facing pressure from lingering sec@@ tarian tensions in indonesia , where members of the muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith .
more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dis@@ located from their homes as christian and muslim gangs batt@@ led on the streets , using ma@@ che@@ tes , bows and arrows , and other crude weapons .

parliament 's statue of cro@@ m@@ well becomes latest memorial hit by ' re@@ writing history ' row
its ban@@ ishment would be poetic justice for his tali@@ ban@@ -@@ like destruction of so many of england 's cultural and religious arte@@ facts carried out by his fana@@ tical pur@@ itan followers .
but the cro@@ m@@ well society described mr cr@@ ick 's suggestion as " fol@@ ly " and " attempting to rewrite history . "
john gold@@ smith , chairman of the cro@@ m@@ well society , said : " it was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of oliver cro@@ m@@ well outside the palace of west@@ minster would become a target .
the ic@@ ono@@ cl@@ asm of the english civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by cro@@ m@@ well .
perhaps the wrong cro@@ m@@ well would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor thomas in the previous century .
sir william ham@@ o thor@@ ne@@ y@@ cro@@ ft 's magnificent representation of cro@@ m@@ well is evidence of 19@@ th century opinion and part of the histori@@ ography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating .
mr gold@@ smith told the sunday telegraph : " cro@@ m@@ well is regarded by many , perhaps more in the late 19@@ th century than today , as a defender of parliament against external pressure , in his case of course the monarchy .
whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate .
what is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17@@ th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and cro@@ m@@ well is an individual recogn@@ is@@ able figure who represents one side of that divide .
his achievements as lord protector are also worth celebrating and commemor@@ ating . "
killer pig ma@@ ul@@ s chinese farmer to death
a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest china , according to local media reports .
the man , identified only by his surname " yuan , " was found dead with a severed artery , covered in blood near a sty at the market in liup@@ an@@ shui in guizhou province , the south china morning post reported sunday .
a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a ho@@ gg@@ ery on may 30 , 2005 in xining of qinghai province , china .
he had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring yunnan province wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market .
the following morning , his cousin found him dead , and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open .
he said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth .
a forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had ma@@ uled the farmer to death , according to the report .
" my cousin 's legs were bloody and mang@@ led , " the cousin , referred to by his surname " wu , " said , as quoted by the guiyang evening news .
security camera footage showed yuan entering the market at 4.@@ 40 am thursday to feed his pigs .
his body was found about an hour later .
the animal who killed the man did not belong to yuan or his cousin .
a market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else , while police gathered evidence at the scene .
yuan 's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death .
though rare , cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before .
in 2016 , a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in massachusetts , leaving the man with critical injuries .
ten years previously , a 650 pound pig pinned a wel@@ sh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away .
after an oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012 , one man@@ it@@ oba farmer told c@@ bc news that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a " trigger . "
" they 're just being playful .
they 're ni@@ ppers , very inqu@@ isi@@ tive ... they aren 't out to hurt you .
you just have to pay them the right amount of respect , " he said .
hurricane rosa 's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest us
as forecast , hurricane rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of mexico .
however , rosa will bring flooding rains across northern mexico and the southwest u.s. over the coming days .
rosa had winds of 85 mph , a category 1 hurricane , as of 5 a.@@ m. eastern time sunday , and was located 3@@ 85 miles southwest of pun@@ ta eu@@ gen@@ ia , mexico .
rosa is expected to move north on sunday .
meanwhile , a trough is beginning to take shape over the pacific ocean and move east toward the west coast of the u.s. as rosa approaches the ba@@ ja california peninsula on monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture north@@ ward into the southwest u.@@ s .
rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of mexico on monday .
then , tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days .
locally , 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding , debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert .
deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots , especially in parts of southern nevada and arizona .
as much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest , especially over much of arizona .
flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain .
it would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall .
heavy rain could cause can@@ y@@ ons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gu@@ sty winds and blowing dust .
the approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the southern california coastline .
rainfall tot@@ als of over half an inch are possible , which could cause minor debris flows and sl@@ ick road@@ ways .
this would be the region 's first rainfall of their wet season .
some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach arizona late sunday and early monday , before the rain becomes more widespread late monday and tuesday .
heavy rain will spread into the four corners on tuesday and last through wednesday .
october can see some intense temperature swings across the u.s. as the arctic gets cooler , but the tro@@ pics remain quite warm .
sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances .
there is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central u.s. on sunday .
there is nearly a 20@@ -@@ degree temperature difference between kansas city , missouri , and oma@@ ha , nebraska , and between st@@ . louis and des mo@@ ines , iowa .
over the next few days , lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again .
much of the central and eastern u.s. is expected to see a warm start to october with widespread 80@@ s from the southern plains to parts of the northeast .
new york city could reach 80 degrees on tuesday , which would be approximately 10 degrees above average .
our long term climate forecast is indicating high chances for above@@ -@@ average temperatures for the eastern u.s. through the first half of october .
more than 20 million people watched bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh hearing
more than 20 million people watched thursday 's gri@@ pping testimony by supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 198@@ 0@@ s , christine blas@@ ey ford , on six television networks .
meanwhile , the political stan@@ doff continued , with broad@@ ca@@ sters interrupting regular programming for friday 's last@@ -@@ minute twist : an agreement engineered by arizona sen@@ . jeff flake for the fbi to conduct a one@@ -@@ week investigation of the charges .
ford told the senate judiciary committee that she 's 100 percent certain that k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh gro@@ ped her drun@@ kenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party .
k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , in imp@@ assi@@ oned testimony , said he 's 100 percent certain that it didn 't happen .
it 's likely that more than the 20.@@ 4 million people reported by ni@@ el@@ sen on friday watched it .
the company was counting average view@@ ership on cbs , abc , nbc , cnn , fox news channel and m@@ sn@@ bc .
figures weren 't immediately available for other networks that showed it , including p@@ bs , c@@ -@@ span and the fox business network .
and ni@@ el@@ sen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices .
to put that in perspective , that 's an audience size similar to that for a play@@ off football game or the academy awards .
fox news channel , whose opinion hosts have strongly backed k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's appointment , led all networks with an average of 5.@@ 69 million viewers during the all@@ -@@ day hearing , ni@@ el@@ sen said .
abc was second with 3.@@ 26 million viewers .
cbs had 3.1 million , nbc had 2.@@ 94 million , m@@ sn@@ bc had 2.@@ 89 million and cnn had 2.@@ 52 million , ni@@ el@@ sen said .
interest remained high after the hearing .
flake was the central figure in friday 's drama .
after the moderate republican 's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , he was caught be cnn and cbs cameras friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a judiciary committee hearing .
he stood with eyes down@@ cast for several minutes as he was ber@@ ated , tele@@ vised live on cnn .
" i 'm standing right here in front of you , " one woman said .
" do you think he 's telling the truth to the country ?
he was told , " you have power when so many women are powerless . " "
flake said that his office had issued a statement and said , before the elevator closed , that he would have more to say at the committee hearing .
the cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later , when the judiciary committee was to vote to advance k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's nomination to the full senate for a vote .
but flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the fbi would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week , which minority democrats have been urging .
flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend , democratic sen@@ . chris co@@ ons .
after a conversation with co@@ ons and several senators afterwards , flake made his decision .
flake 's choice had power , because it was evident republicans would not have the votes to approve k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh without the investigation .
president trump has opened an fbi investigation into the allegations against k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh .

police clash with cat@@ alan separati@@ sts ahead of independence vote anniversary
six people were arrested in barcelona on saturday after pro@@ -@@ independence protesters clashed with riot police , and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of catal@@ onia 's polar@@ izing vote on sec@@ ession .
a group of masked pro@@ -@@ separati@@ sts held back by riot police pel@@ ted them with eggs and hur@@ led powder paint , creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thr@@ ong@@ ed with tourists .
scu@@ ffles also broke out later in the day with police using their bat@@ ons to contain the fighting .
over several hours pro@@ -@@ independence groups chan@@ ting " no forgetting , no forgiveness " faced off with uni@@ onist protesters shouting , " long live spain . "
fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests , local press reported .
tensions remain high in the indepen@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ minded region a year after the october 1 referendum deemed illegal by madrid but celebrated by separatist catal@@ ans .
voters chose overwhel@@ m@@ ingly to become independent , though turnout was low with those against sec@@ ession largely boy@@ co@@ tting the vote .
according to cat@@ alan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes .
pro@@ -@@ independence groups had cam@@ ped out overnight on friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police .
the demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route .
nar@@ cis ter@@ mes , 68 , an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of catal@@ onia gaining independence .
" last year we lived through one of our best moments .
i watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck , " he said .
despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last december , cat@@ alan pro@@ -@@ independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence .
joan pu@@ ig , a 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone , said the conflict had been sto@@ ked by politicians on both sides .
" it 's getting more and more tense , " he said .
on saturday , ori@@ ol jun@@ quer@@ as , one of nine cat@@ alan leaders in pre@@ -@@ trial jail since late last year , announced he would run in european parliament elections next year .
" standing as a candidate for the european elections is the best way to den@@ ounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the spanish government , " he said .

meng@@ a strike gives li@@ ving@@ ston 1@@ -@@ 0 win over rang@@ ers
dolly meng@@ a 's first goal for li@@ ving@@ ston secured victory
promoted li@@ ving@@ ston stunned rang@@ ers to con@@ sign steven ger@@ r@@ ard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the i@@ bro@@ x club .
dolly meng@@ a 's strike proved to be the difference as gary hol@@ t 's side moved level with hiber@@ nian in second .
ger@@ r@@ ard 's side remain without an away win in the premi@@ ership this season and face leaders hearts , who they trail by eight points , next sunday .
before then , rang@@ ers host rapid vienna in the euro@@ pa league on thursday .
li@@ ving@@ ston , meanwhile , extend their un@@ beaten run in the division to six games , with head coach hol@@ t still to taste defeat since replacing kenny mil@@ er last month .
li@@ ving@@ ston miss chances against blunt visitors
hol@@ t 's team should have been ahead long before they scored , with their direc@@ tness causing rang@@ ers all manner of problems .
scott robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal , then alan lith@@ gow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet craig hal@@ kett 's header across goal .
the hosts were content to let rang@@ ers play in front of them , knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces .
and that was the manner in which the crucial goal came .
rang@@ ers conce@@ ded a free@@ -@@ kick and li@@ ving@@ ston worked an opening , dec@@ lan gall@@ ag@@ her and robinson combining to set up meng@@ a , who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box .
by that stage , rang@@ ers had dominated possession but had found the home defence im@@ penetra@@ ble and goalkeeper liam kelly was largely un@@ troubled ,
that pattern continued into the second half , though al@@ fre@@ do more@@ los did force a save from kelly .
scott pit@@ t@@ man was denied by the feet of rang@@ ers goalkeeper all@@ an mc@@ greg@@ or and lith@@ gow flic@@ ked wide from another li@@ ving@@ ston set play .
crosses continually came into the li@@ ving@@ ston box and were continually cleared , while two penalty claims - after hal@@ kett 's challenge on substitute glenn middle@@ ton , and one for hand@@ ball - were waved away .
'@@ phenomen@@ al ' from li@@ ving@@ ston - analysis
bbc scotland 's al@@ as@@ da@@ ir lam@@ on@@ t at the tony mac@@ ar@@ oni arena
a phenomen@@ al performance and result for li@@ ving@@ ston .
to a man , they were excellent , continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory .
their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight , but great credit has to go to hol@@ t for the way he has galvan@@ ised the team since his arrival .
he had so many heroes .
captain hal@@ kett was immense , marsh@@ alling a super@@ bly@@ -@@ organised defence , while meng@@ a kept connor gold@@ son and joe wor@@ r@@ all on their toes throughout .
rang@@ ers were short of inspiration , though .
as good as they have been at times under ger@@ r@@ ard , they fell well short of those standards .
their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wa@@ ke@@ -@@ up call for rang@@ ers , who find themselves in mid@@ -@@ table .
erdogan get mixed reception in cologne
there were smiles and blue skies on saturday ( september 29 ) as the leaders of turkey and germany met for break@@ ast in berlin .
it 's the last day of president erdogan 's controversial visit to germany - which is aimed at repairing relations be@@ teen the nato allies .

hundreds of anti@@ -@@ erdogan protesters - many of them kurdish - also made their voices heard , condem@@ ning both erdogan 's policies and the german government 's decision to welcome him to the country .
the du@@ eling protests reflect the di@@ visi@@ veness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some german tur@@ ks and rev@@ iled as an auto@@ cr@@ at by others .

long lar@@ tin prison : six officers hurt in disorder
six prison officers have been injured in a disturbance at a high security men 's jail , the prison office has said .
disorder broke out at h@@ mp long lar@@ tin in wor@@ ce@@ ster@@ shire at about 09 : 30 b@@ st on sunday and is ongoing .
specialist " tornado " officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance , which involves eight inmates and is contained to one wing .

six members of staff have been treated for injuries .
we do not tolerate violence in our prisons , and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars . "

and in october last year riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls .
hurricane rosa threatening phoenix , las vegas , salt lake city with flash flooding ( drought areas may benefit )
it 's rare for a tropical depression to hit arizona , but that 's exactly what 's likely to happen early happen early next week as hurricane rosa 's remaining energy tracks across the desert southwest , delivering flash flooding risks .
the national weather service has already issued flash flood watches for monday and tuesday for western arizona into southern and eastern nevada , southeastern california and utah , including the cities of phoenix , flag@@ staff , las vegas , and salt lake city .
rosa is expected to take a direct path over phoenix on tuesday , approaching late monday with rain .
the national weather service in phoenix noted in a tweet that only " ten tropical cycl@@ ones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of phoenix since 1950 !
kat@@ rina ( 1967 ) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the az border . "
the latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall , with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the mo@@ gol@@ lon rim of arizona .
other areas of the desert southwest including the central rock@@ ies and the great basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches , with isolated tot@@ als up to 4 inches possible .
for those out of flash flood risk , rosa 's rain may be a blessing since the region is dr@@ ough@@ t@@ -@@ stricken .
although flooding is a very serious concern , some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions .
according to the u.s. drought monitor , just over 40 percent of arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought , the second highest category , " weather@@ .@@ com reported .
first , hurricane rosa 's path leads to land@@ fall across the ba@@ ja california peninsula of mexico .
rosa , still at hurricane strength sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour , is 3@@ 85 miles south of pun@@ ta eu@@ gen@@ ia , mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour .
the storm is encountering cooler waters in the pacific and therefore powering down .
thus , it 's expected to make land@@ fall in mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on monday .
rainfall across portions of mexico could be heavy , posing a significant flooding risk .
" rainfall tot@@ als of 3 to 6 inches are expected from ba@@ ja california into northwestern son@@ ora , with up to 10 inches possible , " weather@@ .@@ com reported .
rosa will then track north across mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the arizona border in the early morning hours tuesday as a tropical depression , which will then track up through arizona and into southern utah by late tuesday night .
" the main hazard expected from rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in ba@@ ja california , northwestern son@@ ora , and the u.s. desert southwest , " the national hurricane center said .
these rains are expected to produce life@@ -@@ threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts , and landslides in mountainous terrain .

trump says k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh ' suffered , the mean@@ ness , the anger ' of the democratic party
" a vote for judge k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the democratic party , " trump said at a rally in whe@@ eling , west virginia .
trump said that k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh has " suffered the mean@@ ness , the anger " of the democratic party throughout his nomination process .
k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh testified before congress on thursday , force@@ fully and emotionally denying an alleg@@ ation from christine blas@@ ey ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers .
ford also testified at the hearing about her alleg@@ ation .
the president said on saturday that the " american people saw the brilliant and quality and courage " of k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh that day .
" a vote to confirm judge k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time , a jur@@ ist with a sterling record of public service , " he told the crowd of west virginia supporters .
the president ob@@ liqu@@ ely referred to k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's nomination while talking about the importance of republican turnout in the mid@@ term elections .
" five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life@@ times .
i 'm not running , but i 'm really running , " he said .

hundreds killed by indonesian quake , tsunami , with toll seen rising
at least 3@@ 84 people were killed , many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches , when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the indonesian island of su@@ law@@ esi , authorities said on saturday .
hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of pal@@ u on friday when waves as high as six meters ( 18 feet ) smashed on@@ shore at dusk , sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path .
the tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake .
" when the tsunami threat arose yesterday , people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims , " su@@ top@@ o pur@@ wo nu@@ gro@@ ho , the spokesman for indonesia 's disaster mitigation agency bn@@ pb said in a briefing in jakarta .
" the tsunami didn 't come by itself , it dragged cars , logs , houses , it hit everything on land , " nu@@ gro@@ ho said , adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 k@@ ph ( 4@@ 97 mph ) before striking the sho@@ re@@ line .
some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived , he said .
around 16,@@ 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in pal@@ u .
aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed , bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water .
after@@ shocks continued to rock the coastal city on saturday .
the series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people .
indonesia 's agency for the assessment and application of technology ( b@@ pp@@ t ) said in statement the energy released by friday 's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima in world war two .
the geography of the city , which sits at the end of a long , narrow bay , could have magni@@ fied the size of the tsunami , it said .
nu@@ gro@@ ho described the damage as " extensive " and said thousands of houses , hospitals , shopping malls and hotels had collapsed .
bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings , he said , adding 5@@ 40 people were injured and 29 were missing .
nu@@ gro@@ ho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km ( 190 miles ) north of pal@@ u , an area called dong@@ gala , which is closer to the epic@@ enter of the quake .
communications " were totally crip@@ pled with no information " from dong@@ gala , nu@@ gro@@ ho said .
there are more than 300,000 people living there , " the red cross said in a statement , adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas .
" this is already a tragedy , but it could get much worse , " it said .
the agency on saturday was widely criticized for not in@@ forming that a tsunami had hit pal@@ u , though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued .
in amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting fran@@ tic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below .
within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore , carrying away buildings and cars .
reuters was not able to immediately authentic@@ ate the footage .
the quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around pal@@ u making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts .
the military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from jakarta and other cities , authorities said , but evacu@@ ees still badly need food and other basic necessities .
the city 's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until oct .
president jo@@ ko wido@@ do was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in pal@@ u on sunday .
indonesia tsunami toll so@@ ars above 800 .
it is very bad .
while world vision 's staff from dong@@ gala have made it safely to pal@@ u city , where employees are shel@@ tering in tar@@ paul@@ in shelters set up in the courtyard of their office , they passed scenes of deva@@ station on the way , mr. do@@ se@@ ba said .
" they told me they saw lots of houses that were destroyed , " he said .
it is very bad .
even as aid groups began the grim motions of starting the gears of disaster relief , some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to pal@@ u .
according to indonesian regulations , funding , supplies and staffing from overseas can only start flowing if the site of a calamity is declared a national disaster zone .
that has not happened yet .
" it 's still a province level disaster , " said au@@ lia arri@@ ani , a spokesperson for the indonesian red cross .
" once the government says , " o@@ .@@ k@@ . , this is a national disaster , " we can open for international assistance but there 's no status yet . "
as the second night fell on pal@@ u after friday 's earthquake and tsunami , friends and family of those still missing were holding out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that lea@@ ven the bleak story lines of natural disasters .
on saturday , a little boy was pluc@@ ked from a sewer .
on sunday , rescuers freed a woman who had been pinned under rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her .
gen@@ don sub@@ and@@ ono , the coach of the indonesian national parag@@ li@@ ding team , had trained two of the missing parag@@ li@@ ders for the asian games , which wrapped up earlier this month in indonesia .
others of those trapped at the ro@@ a ro@@ a hotel , mr. man@@ dag@@ i included , were his students .
" as a senior in the parag@@ li@@ ding field , i have my own emotional burden , " he said .
mr. gen@@ don recoun@@ ted how , in the hours after the news of the ro@@ a ro@@ a hotel collapse circulated among the parag@@ li@@ ding community , he had desperately sent what@@ sa@@ pp messages to the pal@@ u competitors , who were taking part in the beach festival .
his messages , though , only resulted in one gray check mark , rather than a pair of blue checks .
" i think that means the messages were not delivered , " he said .

lopez ob@@ rad@@ or promised saturday at t@@ la@@ tel@@ ol@@ co plaza to " never ever use the military to repres@@ s the mexican people . "

u.s. should double a.@@ i. funding
as china becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the u.s. should double the amount it spends on research in the field , says investor and ai practitioner kai@@ -@@ fu lee , who has worked for google , microsoft and apple .
the comments come after various parts of the u.s. government have made ai announcements , even as the u.s. overall lacks a formal ai strategy .
meanwhile , china introduced its plan last year : it 's aiming to be no@@ .@@ 1 in ai innovation by 2030 .
" double the ai research budget would be a good start , given that all other countries are so much farther behind u.s. , and we 're looking for the next breakthrough in ai , " said lee .
doubling funding could double the chances that the next big ai achievement will be made in the u.s. , lee told cn@@ bc in an interview this week .
lee , whose book " ai super@@ powers : china , silicon valley and the new world order " was published this month by hou@@ gh@@ ton mi@@ ff@@ lin har@@ court , is ceo of sino@@ vation ventures , which has invested in one of the most prominent ai companies in china , face + + .
in the 198@@ 0@@ s at carnegie m@@ ell@@ on university he worked on an ai system that beat the high@@ est@@ -@@ ranked american o@@ th@@ ello player , and later he was an executive at microsoft research and president of google 's china branch .
lee acknowledged previous u.s. government technology competitions like the defense advanced research projects agency 's robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be , in order to help identify the next vision@@ aries .
researchers in the u.s. often have to work hard in order to win government grants , lee said .
" it 's not china that is taking away the academic leaders ; it 's the corpor@@ ates , " lee said .
facebook , google and other technology companies have hired lumin@@ aries from universities to work on ai in recent years .
lee said immigration policy changes could also help the u.s. bol@@ ster its ai efforts .
" i think green cards should automatically be offered to phd 's in ai , " he said .
china 's state council issued its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in july 2017 .
china 's national natural science foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the national science foundation and other government organizations dol@@ e out money to u.s. researchers , but the quality of academic work is lower in china , lee said .
earlier this year the u.s. defense department established a joint artificial intelligence center , which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia , and the white house announced the formation of select committee on artificial intelligence .
and this month dar@@ pa announced a $ 2 billion investment in an initiative called ai next .
as for the n@@ sf , it currently invests more than $ 100 million per year in ai research .
meanwhile , u.s. legislation that sought to create a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not seen action in months .
maced@@ oni@@ ans vote in referendum on whether to change country 's name
the people of macedonia voted in a referendum on sunday on whether to change its name to " republic of north macedonia , " a move that would resolve a decad@@ es@@ -@@ old dispute with greece which had blocked its membership bids for the european union and nato .
greece , which has a province called macedonia , maintains that its northern neighbor 's name represents a claim on its territory and has ve@@ to@@ ed its entrance into nato and the eu .
the two governments struck a deal in june based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of macedonia 's sla@@ vic majority population .
president g@@ jor@@ ge ivan@@ ov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid .
the question on the referendum ballot read : " are you for nato and eu membership with acceptance of the agreement with greece . "
supporters of the name change , including prime minister z@@ or@@ an za@@ ev , argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the eu and nato for macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of yugoslavia .
" i came today to vote for the future of the country , for young people in macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the european union because it means safer lives for all of us , " said oli@@ vera geor@@ gi@@ j@@ ev@@ ska , 79 , in sk@@ op@@ je .
although not legally binding , enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote 's outcome to make it decisive .
the name change would requires a two@@ -@@ thirds majority in parliament .
the state election commission said there had been no reports of ir@@ regularities by 1 p.@@ m .
however , turnout stood at only 16 percent , compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot .
" i came out to vote because of my children , our place is in europe , " said g@@ jose tan@@ ev@@ ski , 62 , a voter in the capital , sk@@ op@@ je .
macedonia 's pm z@@ or@@ an za@@ ev , his wife z@@ or@@ ica and his son du@@ sh@@ ko cast their ballot for the referendum in macedonia on changing the country 's name that would open the way for it to join nato and the european union in str@@ um@@ ica , macedonia september 30 , 2018 .
in front of parliament in sk@@ op@@ je , vladimir k@@ av@@ ar@@ dar@@ kov , 54 , was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .
" we are for nato and eu , but we want to join with our heads up , not through the service door " k@@ av@@ ad@@ ar@@ kov said .
" we are a poor country , but we do have dignity .
if they don 't want to take us as macedonia , we can turn to others like china and russia and become part of euro@@ -@@ asia integration . "
prime minister za@@ ev says nato membership will bring much needed investment to macedonia , which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
" i believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of eu and nato , " za@@ ev said after casting his ballot .
he said that a " yes " result would be " confirmation of our future . "
a poll published last monday by macedonia 's institute for policy research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout .
another poll , conducted by macedonia 's tel@@ ma tv , found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on sunday .
of those , 70 percent said they would vote yes .
for the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote .
a failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro@@ -@@ western government since it took over in may last year .

sch@@ er@@ zer wants to play spo@@ iler v@@ s. rock@@ ies
with the nationals eliminated from play@@ off conten@@ tion , there wasn 't much reason to force another start .
but the ever@@ -@@ competitive sch@@ er@@ zer hopes to take the m@@ ound on sunday against the colorado rock@@ ies , but only if there are still play@@ off implications for the rock@@ ies , who hold a one@@ -@@ game lead over the los angeles do@@ d@@ gers in the n@@ l west .
the rock@@ ies clin@@ ched at least a wild@@ -@@ card spot with a 5@@ -@@ 2 win over the nationals on friday night , but are still looking to lock up their first division title .
" even though we 're playing for nothing , at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point i would face this year .
why wouldn 't i want to compete in that ? "
the nationals have yet to announce a starter for sunday , but are reportedly inclined to let sch@@ er@@ zer pitch in such a situation .
sch@@ er@@ zer , who would be making his 34@@ th start , threw a bull@@ pen session on thursday and would be pit@@ ching on his normal rest sunday .

trump r@@ allies in west virginia
the president ob@@ liqu@@ ely referred to the situation surrounding his supreme court pick bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh while talking about the importance of republican turnout in the mid@@ term elections .
" all of what we 've done is at stake in november .
five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life@@ times .
this is one of the big , big -@@ - i 'm not running but i 'm really running that 's why i 'm all over the place fighting for great candidates , " he said .
trump continued , " you see this horrible , horrible radical group of democrats , you see it happening right now .
and they 're determined to take back power by using any means necessary , you see the mean@@ ness , the na@@ st@@ iness .
they don 't care who they hurt , who they have to run over in order to get power and control , that 's what they want is power and control , we 're not going to give it to them . "
democrats , he said , are on a mission to " resist and obstruc@@ t . "
" and you see that over the last four days , " he said , calling the democrats " angry and mean and nasty and un@@ tru@@ thful . "
he referenced senate judiciary committee ranking democratic sen@@ . di@@ anne fe@@ instein by name , which received loud boo@@ s from the audience .
" remember her answer ?
did you leak the document ?
uh , uh , what .
no , uh no , i wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language i 've ever seen . "
labour is no longer a broad church .
it is in@@ tolerant of those who speak their minds
when momentum 's activists in my local party voted to cen@@ sure me , it was hardly a surprise .
after all , i 'm the latest in a line of labour mps to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds .
my parliamentary colleague joan ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to anti@@ semi@@ tism .
in my case , the cen@@ sure motion critic@@ ised me for dis@@ agreeing with jeremy cor@@ by@@ n .
on the importance of a responsible economic policy , on national security , on europe , ironically similar issues on which jeremy disagreed with previous leaders .
the notice for the no@@ tting@@ ham east labour meeting on friday stated that " we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive . "
for most of my eight years as the local labour mp , the friday night gc meetings have been exactly that .
sadly today , it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of " kin@@ der , gent@@ ler " politics has long been forgotten if , indeed , it ever began .
it has become increasingly apparent that diff@@ ering views are not tolerated in the labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership .
this started shortly after jeremy became leader , as colleagues with whom i had previously thought i shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a u@@ -@@ turn and take positions i would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the eu single market .
whenever i speak publicly - and it doesn 't really matter what i say - there follows a ti@@ ra@@ de of abuse on social media calling for des@@ election , den@@ oun@@ cing the politics of the centre , telling me i should not be in the labour party .
and that is not just my experience .
indeed , i know i am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political .
i am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a tor@@ rent of sex@@ ist or racist abuse every day but never shy away .
one of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normal@@ ised .
jeremy cor@@ by@@ n claimed last week that the labour party should foster a culture of tolerance .
the reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every " no@@ -@@ confidence " motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narro@@ wer .
i have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down , not to be so vocal and then i would " be all right . "
but that is not what i came into politics to do .
ever since i joined labour 32 years ago as a school pupil , provoked by the thatcher government 's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down , i 've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local counc@@ ill@@ or or government minister .
i have never hidden my politics , including at the last election .
no one in no@@ tting@@ ham east could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership .
to those who promoted the motion on friday , all i would say is that when the country is pl@@ ough@@ ing towards a brexit that will hurt households , businesses and our public services , i do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the labour party leader .
but really the one message i have is not to no@@ tting@@ ham momentum , it is to my constituents , whether labour members or not : i am proud to serve you and i promise that no amount of des@@ election threats or political expedi@@ ency will deter me from acting in what i believe are the best interests of you all .

ay@@ r 38 - 17 mel@@ rose : un@@ beaten ay@@ r go top
two late tries may have ske@@ wed the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt ay@@ r deserved to triumph in this wonder@@ ful@@ ly@@ -@@ entertaining ten@@ n@@ ent 's premi@@ ership match of the day .
they now top the table , the only un@@ beaten side of the ten .
in the end , it was their superior defence , as much as their better chan@@ ce@@ -@@ taking , which carried the home side and coach peter mur@@ chie had every right to be pleased .
" we 've been tested over our games this far , and we 're still un@@ beaten , so i have to be happy , " he said .
ro@@ by@@ n christie of mel@@ rose said : " credit to ay@@ r , they took their chances better than we did . "
grant anderson 's 14@@ th minute try , converted by fra@@ z@@ ier clim@@ o , put ay@@ r in front , but , a yellow card for scotland cap r@@ ory hughes , released for the game by warriors , allowed mel@@ rose to make numbers tell and jason bag@@ got grabbed an un@@ converted try .
clim@@ o stretched the ay@@ r lead with a penalty , before , right on half@@ -@@ time , he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17@@ -@@ 5 to ay@@ r at the break .
but mel@@ rose began the second half well and patrick anderson 's try , converted by bag@@ got , reduced the lee@@ way to five points .
there was then a lengthy hold@@ -@@ up for a serious injury to ru@@ ar@@ id@@ h kno@@ tt , who was stret@@ che@@ red off , and from the restart , ay@@ r surged further ahead through a staf@@ ford mc@@ do@@ wall try , converted by clim@@ o .
ay@@ r acting captain blair mac@@ ph@@ erson was then yellow@@ -@@ car@@ ded , and again , mel@@ rose made the extra man pay with an un@@ converted bruce col@@ vine try , at the end of a spell of fierce pressure .
the home side came back , however , and when stru@@ an hu@@ t@@ chin@@ son was yellow@@ -@@ car@@ ded for tackling clim@@ o without the ball , from the penalty line@@ -@@ out , mac@@ ph@@ erson touched down at the back of the advancing ay@@ r ma@@ ul .
clim@@ o converted , as he did again almost from the restart , after kyle ro@@ we gathered david armstrong 's box kick and sent flan@@ ker greg@@ or henry away for the home side 's fifth try .

'@@ the sea is ours ' : land@@ locked bolivia hopes court will reopen path to pacific
sailors patrol a ri@@ gg@@ ing@@ -@@ clad naval headquarters in la pa@@ z .
public buildings fly an ocean@@ -@@ blue flag .
naval bases from lake ti@@ tic@@ aca to the amazon are dau@@ bed with the motto : " the sea is ours by right .
to recover it is a duty . "
throughout land@@ locked bolivia , the memory of a coastline lost to chile in a bloody 19@@ th@@ -@@ century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the pacific ocean once more .
those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades , as bolivia awa@@ its a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 october after five years of deliber@@ ations .
" bolivia has the momentum , a spirit of unity and seren@@ ity , and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome , " said rober@@ to cal@@ z@@ ad@@ illa , a boli@@ vian diplomat .
many boli@@ vi@@ ans will watch the ic@@ j ruling on big screens across the country , hopeful that the tribunal in the hague will find in favour of bolivia 's claim that - after decades of fit@@ ful talks - chile is obliged to negotiate granting bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea .
evo mor@@ ales , bolivia 's charis@@ matic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re@@ -@@ election next year - also has plenty riding on monday 's ruling .
" we are very close to returning to the pacific ocean , " he vowed in late august .
but some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in bolivia 's favour - and that little would change if it did .
the nether@@ land@@ s@@ -@@ based un body has no power to award chilean territory , and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .
that the ic@@ j 's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case " wasn 't complicated , " said pa@@ z z@@ á@@ rate , a chilean expert in international law .
and far from fur@@ thering bolivia 's cause , the past four years may have set it back .
" the issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current boli@@ vian administration , " said z@@ á@@ rate .
mor@@ ales 's bel@@ li@@ ge@@ rent rhetoric has sa@@ pped any residual chilean goodwill , she suggested .
bolivia and chile will at some point continue to talk , but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this .
the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 .
former president e@@ du@@ ardo ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez vel@@ tz@@ é , bolivia 's representative at the hague , rejected the idea that the court 's decis@@ ion@@ -@@ making was unusually speedy .
monday will bring bolivia " an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with chile " and a chance to " put an end to 1@@ 39 years of dis@@ agreements with mutual benefits , " he said .
cal@@ z@@ ad@@ illa also denied that mor@@ ales - still one of latin america 's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political cru@@ tch .
" bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the pacific ocean , " he added .
" the ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past . "
north korea says nuclear disarmament won 't come unless it can trust us
north korean foreign minister ri yong ho says his nation will never dis@@ arm its nuclear weapons first if it can 't trust washington .
ri was speaking saturday at the united nations general assembly .
he called on the united states to follow through on promises made during a summit in singapore between the rivals ' leaders .
his comments come as us . secretary of state mike pompe@@ o seems to be on the verge of re@@ starting dead@@ locked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the singapore with north korea 's kim jong un .
ri says it 's a " pipe dream " that continued sanctions and u.s. objection to a declaration ending the korean war will ever bring the north to its knees .
washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves .
both kim and u.s. president donald trump want a second summit .
but there is widespread skep@@ ticism that pyongyang is serious about ren@@ oun@@ cing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety .
pompe@@ o is planning to visit pyongyang next month to prepare for a second kim@@ -@@ trump summit .

john edward : languages skills essential for global citizens
scotland 's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence , and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results , which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports , art , music and other community endeav@@ ours .
with upwards of 30,000 pupils across scotland , these schools , represented by the scottish council of independent schools ( sc@@ is ) , strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents .
independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education , their chosen career and their place as global citizens .
as an education sector that can design and implement a bes@@ poke school curriculum , we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools .
nelson mandela said : " if you talk to a man in a language he understands , that goes to his head .
if you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart . "
this is a powerful reminder that we can 't just rely on english when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .
from this year 's recent exam results , we can see that languages are top@@ ping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools .
a total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade a .
the data , collected from sc@@ is 's 74 member schools , showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher grade a in mandarin , while 72 per cent of those studying german , 69 per cent of those studying french and 63 per cent studying spanish also achieved an a .
this demonstrates that independent schools in scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future .
languages now , as a subject choice , are being held in the same regard as stem subjects ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) in independent school curricul@@ ums and elsewhere .
a survey by the uk commission for employment and skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies , 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage .
therefore more and more , language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers .
with more prospective job opportunities requiring languages , these skills are essential in a glob@@ alised world .
regardless of the career someone chooses , if they 've learned a second language , they 'll have a real advantage in the future having a life@@ -@@ long skill such as this .
being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multi@@ lingual person ahead of the competition .
according to a you@@ go@@ v poll of more than 4,000 uk adults in 2013 , 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with french being the only language spoken by a doub@@ le@@ -@@ digit percentage , 15 per cent .
this is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today 's children .
having multiple languages , particularly those of developing economies , will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment .
within scotland , each school will differ in the languages they teach .
a number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages , whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the uk when looking ahead to 2020 , such as mandarin or japanese .
whatever your child 's interest , there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools , with teaching staff who are specialists in this area .
scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed , whatever the future holds .
it can 't be denied at this time , in a global business environment , that languages continue to be vit@@ ally important to the country 's future , so this must be mir@@ ro@@ red in education .
indeed , modern languages should really be considered " international communication skills . "
independent schools will continue to offer this choice , diversity and excellence for scotland 's young people .

trump 's west virginia rally time , youtube channel
president donald trump begins a fl@@ urry of campaign r@@ allies tonight in whe@@ eling , west virginia .
it 's trump 's first of five scheduled r@@ allies in the next week , including stops in friendly places including tennessee and mississippi .
with the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the supreme court vacancy , trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid@@ -@@ term elections since republicans are at risk of losing control of congress when votes are cast on nov .
what time is trump 's west virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online ?
trump 's whe@@ eling , west virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.@@ m. et tonight , saturday , september 29 , 2018 .
you can watch trump 's west virginia rally online below via live stream on youtube .
trump is likely to address this week 's hearings for supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the fbi investigates .
but the primary aim of this fl@@ urry of r@@ allies is helping republicans facing touch november elections gain some momentum .
thus , president trump 's campaign said these five r@@ allies in the next week are aimed at " energ@@ izing volunteers and supporters as republicans try to protect and expand the maj@@ orities they hold in the senate and house of representatives , " according to reuters .
" control of congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season , " a trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told reuters .
scheduled for wes@@ ban@@ co arena in whe@@ eling , tonight 's rally could bring supporters from " ohio and pennsylvania and draw coverage from the pittsburgh media , " according to the west virginia metro news .
saturday will be the second time in the past month that trump has visited west virginia , the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 .
trump is trying to help west virginia republican senate candidate patrick mor@@ ris@@ ey , who is trailing in the polls .
" it 's not a good sign for mor@@ ris@@ ey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls , " said simon ha@@ e@@ der , a political scientist at west virginia university , according to reuters .
ry@@ der cup 2018 : team usa show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into sunday singles
after three one@@ -@@ sided sessions , saturday afternoon 's four@@ somes might just have been what this ry@@ der cup needed .
the swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in , and never more so than at competitions like these .
so where would they say the momentum is now ?
" they had a six@@ -@@ point lead and now it 's four , so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum i guess , " said jordan sp@@ ie@@ th as he stroll@@ ed off for the day .
europe have the advantage , of course , four points ahead with twelve more in play .
the americans , as sp@@ ie@@ th says , feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by , not least the form of sp@@ ie@@ th and justin thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four .
sp@@ ie@@ th has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example .
those gu@@ t@@ tural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on , sinking a crucial pu@@ tt to take match four all@@ -@@ square when he and thomas had been two down after two .
his pu@@ tt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream , the sort that tells you he believes that the american team is not out of this .
" you 've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match , " sp@@ ie@@ th said .
it is all each of these players has left now .
18 holes to make a mark .
the only players with more points than sp@@ ie@@ th and thomas over the past two days are franc@@ esco mol@@ in@@ ari and tommy fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood , the indisputable story of the ry@@ der cup .
europe 's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong .
" mol@@ i@@ wood " were the only pair not to shoot a bo@@ ge@@ y on saturday afternoon , but they also avoided bo@@ ge@@ ys on saturday morning , friday afternoon and the back nine on friday morning .
that run , and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this bo@@ i@@ ster@@ ous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on sunday , and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential european victory as the sun sets over le golf national than fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood or mol@@ in@@ ari .
preferably both simultaneously on different holes .
talk of european glory remains premature , though .
bub@@ ba watson and web@@ b simpson made short work of ser@@ gio garcia , the morning 's four@@ balls hero , when he was paired with alex no@@ ren .
a bo@@ ge@@ y and two doubles on the front nine dug the spani@@ ard and the swe@@ de into a hole they never got close to climbing out of .
on sunday , though , there is nobody to help you out of your hole .
the four@@ balls and four@@ somes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pa@@ ir@@ ings , the advice they give , the advice they don 't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant .
europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this four@@ somes session also showed that team usa has the stomach for the fight that some , especially state@@ side , had been doub@@ ting .
europe take 10@@ -@@ 6 lead into ry@@ der cup final day
europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the ry@@ der cup after emerging from saturday 's four@@ balls and four@@ somes matches with a 10@@ -@@ 6 lead over the united states .
inspired duo tommy fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood and franc@@ esco mol@@ in@@ ari led the charge with two victories over a struggling tiger woods to take their tally so far at le golf national to four points .
thomas b@@ jor@@ n 's european side , bidding to retain the trophy they lost at haz@@ el@@ t@@ ine two years ago , dominated a mis@@ firing american side in the morning four@@ balls , taking the series 3@@ -@@ 1 .
the u.s. offered more resistance in the four@@ somes , winning two matches , but they could not eat into the deficit .
jim fur@@ y@@ k 's side need eight points from sunday 's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy .
fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood is the first european rookie to win four points in a row while he and mol@@ in@@ ari , dubbed " mol@@ li@@ wood " after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in ry@@ der cup history .
having crushed woods and patrick reed in the four@@ balls they then g@@ elled super@@ bly to beat a def@@ lated woods and american rookie bry@@ son de@@ cham@@ be@@ au by an even more empha@@ tic 5 & 4 .
woods , who dragged himself through two matches on saturday , showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four@@ balls and four@@ somes and seven in a row .
justin rose , rested for the morning four@@ balls , returned to partner hen@@ ri@@ k sten@@ son in the four@@ somes to a 2 & 1 defeat of dus@@ tin johnson and brooks ko@@ ep@@ ka - ranked one and three in the world .
europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant , bree@@ zy day south west of paris .
three@@ -@@ times major winner jordan sp@@ ie@@ th and justin thomas set the benchmark for the americans with two points on saturday .
they earned a gr@@ it@@ ty 2 & 1 win over spain 's jon ra@@ hm and ian poul@@ ter in the four@@ balls and returned later to beat poul@@ ter and r@@ ory mc@@ il@@ roy 4 & 3 in the four@@ somes having lost the opening two holes .
only twice in ry@@ der cup history has a team come back from a four@@ -@@ point deficit going into the singles , although as holders fur@@ y@@ k 's side need only draw to retain the trophy .
after being second@@ -@@ best for two days , however , a sunday counter@@ -@@ attack looks as though it will be beyond them .
north korea says ' no way ' will dis@@ arm unilaterally without trust
north korea 's foreign minister told the united nations on saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mi@@ str@@ ust in the united states and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances .
ri yong ho told the world body 's annual general assembly that north korea had taken " significant goodwill measures " in the past year , such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests , dismantling the nuclear test site , and ple@@ dging not to prolifer@@ ate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .
" however , we do not see any corresponding response from the u.s. , " he said .
" without any trust in the u.s. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally dis@@ arm ourselves first . "
while ri re@@ prised familiar north korean complaints about washington 's resistance to a " phased " approach to denuclearization under which north korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps , his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as pyongyang has done in the past .
ri referred to a joint statement issued by kim jong un and donald trump at a first ever summit between a serving u.s. president and a north korean leader in singapore on june 12 , when kim pledged to work toward " denuclearization of the korean peninsula " while trump promised guarantees of north korea 's security .
north korea has been seeking a formal end to the 19@@ 50@@ -@@ 53 korea war , but the united states has said pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first .
washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on north korea .
" the u.s. insists on the " denuclear@@ ization@@ -@@ first " and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coerci@@ ve manner , and even objec@@ ting to the " declaration of the end of war , " " ri said .
" the perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us .
but the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mi@@ str@@ ust . "
ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between kim and trump that the u.s. leader highlighted at the united nations earlier in the week .
the minister instead highlighted three meetings between kim and south korean leader moon ja@@ e@@ -@@ in in the past five months and added : " if the party to this issue of denuclearization were south korea and not the u.s. , the denuclearization of the korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock . "
even so , the tone of ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year , when he told the u.@@ n@@ . general assembly that targeting the u.s. mainland with north korea 's rockets was inevitable after " mr evil president " trump called kim a " rocket man " on a suicide mission .
this year at the united nations , trump , who last year threatened to " totally destroy " north korea , he@@ aped praise on kim for his courage in taking steps to dis@@ arm , but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until north korea denuclear@@ izes .
on wednesday , trump said he did not have a time frame for this , saying " if it takes two years , three years or five months - doesn 't matter . "
china and russia argue that the u.@@ n@@ . security council should reward pyongyang for steps taken .
however , u.s. secretary of state mike pompe@@ o told the u.@@ n@@ . security council on thursday that : " enforcement of security council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully , final , verified denuclearization . "
the security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on north korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
pompe@@ o met ri on the sidelines of the u.@@ n@@ . general assembly and said afterwards that he would visit pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit .
pompe@@ o has visited north korea three times already this year , but his last trip did not go well .
he left pyongyang in july saying that progress had been made , only for north korea within hours to den@@ ounce him for making " gang@@ ster@@ -@@ like demands . "
north korea pledged in a meeting with moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the united states took " corresponding measures . "
he said kim had told him the " corresponding measures " he was seeking were security guarantees trump pledged in singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with washington .
harvard students take course in getting enough rest
a new course at harvard university this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing ma@@ cho culture of studying through caffe@@ ine@@ -@@ fu@@ elled ' all@@ -@@ nigh@@ ters . ' 
an academic found students at the world 's number one university are often clu@@ eless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves .
charles c@@ ze@@ is@@ ler , professor of sleep medicine at harvard medical school and a specialist at the brig@@ ham and women 's hospital , designed the course , which he believes is the first of its kind in the us .
he was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning .
'@@ at the end of it one girl came up to me and said : ' why am i only being told this now , in my senior year ? '
she said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me , ' he told the telegraph .
the course , rolled out for the first time this year , explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance , as well as improve their general well@@ being .
paul bar@@ re@@ ira , professor of psychiat@@ ry at harvard medical school and executive director of the university 's health services , said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week .
the hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks .
in one section there is an image of a dorm room , where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency , and the importance of a bedtime routine .
in another section , participants are told how long@@ -@@ term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks , stroke , depression and cancer .
a map of the campus , with interactive icons , then encourages participants to think about their daily routine .
'@@ we know it won 't change students ' behaviour instantly .
but we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes , ' prof c@@ ze@@ is@@ ler added .
the culture of pride in ' pulling an all@@ -@@ ni@@ ghter ' still exists , he said , adding that modern technology and ever@@ -@@ increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem .
ensuring you have enough sleep , of a good quality , should be a student 's ' secret weapon ' to combat stress , exhaustion and anxiety , he said - even to avoid putting on weight , as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode , making them constantly hungry .
raymond so , a 19@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old califor@@ nian studying chemical and physical biology , helped professor c@@ ze@@ is@@ ler design the course , having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at harvard .
he said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a camp@@ us@@ -@@ wide course .
the next step , he hopes , it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution .
prof c@@ ze@@ is@@ ler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed , as well as for when to wake , and be aware of the harmful effects of ' blue light ' emitted by electronic screens and led lighting , which can throw your cir@@ ca@@ dian rhythm out of kil@@ ter , leading to problems falling asleep .
li@@ ving@@ ston 1 - 0 rang@@ ers : meng@@ a goal downs ger@@ r@@ ard 's men
rang@@ ers suffered another bout of awa@@ y@@ -@@ day blues as dolly meng@@ a 's strike con@@ signed steven ger@@ r@@ ard 's dis@@ join@@ ted side to a 1@@ -@@ 0 defeat at li@@ ving@@ ston .
the i@@ bro@@ x side were looking to record their first win on the road since february 's 4@@ -@@ 1 triumph at st john@@ stone , but gary hol@@ t 's team inflic@@ ted just ger@@ r@@ ard 's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adri@@ ft of runaway lad@@ bro@@ kes premi@@ ership leaders hearts .
meng@@ a struck seven minutes before half@@ -@@ time and a rang@@ ers line@@ -@@ up short on inspiration never looked like level@@ ling .
while rang@@ ers now drop down to sixth spot , li@@ ving@@ ston climb to third and only behind hiber@@ nian on goal difference .
and there could be further trouble in store for rang@@ ers after lin@@ es@@ man cal@@ um sp@@ ence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end .
ger@@ r@@ ard made eight changes to the side which swept past ay@@ r into the bet@@ fred cup semi@@ -@@ finals .
hol@@ t , on the other hand , went with the same li@@ vi 11 which took a point off hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well@@ -@@ drilled outfit suff@@ o@@ cated their opponents at every turn .
rang@@ ers may have dominated possession but li@@ ving@@ ston did more with the ball they had .
they should have scored just two minutes in when meng@@ a 's first@@ -@@ time lay@@ -@@ off sent scott pit@@ t@@ man through on all@@ an mc@@ greg@@ or 's goal but the midfielder tu@@ gged his big chance wide .
a deep ke@@ ag@@ han jacob@@ s free@@ -@@ kick then found ski@@ pper craig hal@@ kett but his defensive partner alan lith@@ gow could only stab wide at the back post .
rang@@ ers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third .
al@@ fre@@ do more@@ los certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter@@ -@@ hour mark as he and steven law@@ less collided but referee steven thom@@ son waved away the colombian 's appeals .
rang@@ ers managed just two first@@ -@@ half shots on target but former i@@ bro@@ x goalkeeper liam kelly was barely troubled by l@@ ass@@ ana cou@@ li@@ bal@@ y 's header and a tame o@@ vie ej@@ aria strike .
while li@@ vi 's 34@@ th@@ -@@ minute opener may have been against the run of play , no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone .
again rang@@ ers failed to deal with a deep jacob@@ s set@@ -@@ piece .
scott ar@@ field did not react as dec@@ lan gall@@ ag@@ her s@@ lot@@ ted the ball to scott robinson , who kept his cool to pick out meng@@ a for a simple finish .
ger@@ r@@ ard acted at the break as he sw@@ apped cou@@ li@@ bal@@ y for ryan kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the w@@ inger s@@ lot@@ ted in more@@ los but the impressive kelly rac@@ ed from his line to block .
but li@@ ving@@ ston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy , with lith@@ gow and hal@@ kett sweeping up long ball after long ball .
hol@@ t 's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but mc@@ greg@@ or stood up well to deny jacob@@ s before lith@@ gow headed wide from the corner .
rang@@ ers substitute glenn middle@@ ton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with jacob@@ s but again thom@@ son looked away .
al@@ man@@ ac : the inventor of the ge@@ ig@@ er counter
and now a page from our " sunday morning " al@@ man@@ ac : september 30 , 18@@ 82 , 1@@ 36 years ago today , and counting ... the day the future physicist johann@@ es wil@@ helm " hans " ge@@ ig@@ er was born in germany .
ge@@ ig@@ er developed a method for detecting and measuring radio@@ activity , an invention that eventually led to the device known as the ge@@ ig@@ er counter .
a mainstay of science ever since , the ge@@ ig@@ er counter became a pop culture mainstay as well , as in the 1950 movie " bells of coron@@ ado , " starring those seemingly unlikely cow@@ poke scientists roy rogers and dale evans :
man : " what in the world is that ? "
rogers : " it 's a ge@@ ig@@ er counter , used to locate radioactive minerals , such as uranium .
when you put these ear@@ phones on , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radio@@ activity in the minerals . "
evans : " say , it sure is popping now ! "
" hans " ge@@ ig@@ er died in 1945 , just a few days short of his 6@@ 3@@ rd birthday .
but the invention that bears his name lives on .

new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ' see ' rogue cells and kill them
vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
method involves extracting immune cells from a patient , alter@@ ing them in lab
they can then ' see ' a protein common to many cancers and then re@@ injected
a trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers .
one woman treated with the vaccine , which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells , saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .
the method involves extracting immune cells from a patient , alter@@ ing them in the laboratory so they can " see " a protein common to many cancers called her@@ 2 , and then re@@ injecting the cells .
professor jay ber@@ z@@ of@@ sky , of the us national cancer institute in be@@ thes@@ da , maryland , said : " our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine . "
her@@ 2 " drives the growth of several types of cancer , " including breast , ovarian , lung and colorectal cancers , prof ber@@ z@@ of@@ sky explained .
a similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and " teaching " them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leu@@ ka@@ emia .
k@@ anye west embarked on a pro@@ -@@ trump di@@ atri@@ be , wearing a mag@@ a hat , after his sn@@ l appearance .
it didn 't go well
k@@ anye west was boo@@ ed in the studio during a saturday night live after a ram@@ bling performance in which he praised u.s. president donald trump and said he would run for office in 2020 .
after performing his third song of the night , called ghost town in which he was wearing a make america great cap , he went on a rant against the democrats and reiterated his support for trump .
" so many times i talk to a white person and they say : " how could you like trump , he 's racist ? "
well , if i was concerned about racism i would 've moved out of america a long time ago , " he said .
sn@@ l started the show with a sk@@ it starring matt damon in which the hollywood star made fun of bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's testimony before the senate judicial committee on sexual assault claims made by christine blas@@ ey ford .
although it was not broadcast , the footage of west 's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian chris rock .
it is unclear if rock was trying to mock west with the posting .
also , west had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear .
" they bullied me backstage .
they said , ' don 't go out there with that hat on . ' 
they bullied me !
and then they say i 'm in a sun@@ ken place , " he said , according to the washington examiner .
west went on : " you wanna see the sun@@ ken place ? " saying that he would " put my superman cape on , because this means you can 't tell me what to do . you want the world to move forward ?
try love . "
his comments drew boo@@ s at least twice from the audience and sn@@ l cast members appeared to be embarrassed , variety reported , with one person there telling the publication : " the entire studio fell dead silent . "
west had been brought in as a late replacement for singer ari@@ ana grande , whose former boyfriend , the ra@@ pper mac miller had died a few days ago .
west puzzled many with a performance of the song i love it , dressed as a per@@ rier bottle .
west got backing from head of conservative group t@@ p@@ usa , cand@@ ace turner who twee@@ ted : " to one of the most courageous spirits : thank you for standing up to the mob . "
but talk show host karen hunter twee@@ ted that west was simply " being who he is and that 's absolutely wonderful . "
" but i chose not to reward someone ( by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his " art " ) who i believe is embracing and spe@@ wing ideology that is harmful to my community .
he is free .
so are we , " she added .
before the show , the ra@@ pper announced on twitter that he had changed his name , saying that he was now " the being formally known as k@@ anye west . "
he is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of did@@ dy , also known as puff daddy , pu@@ ffy and p did@@ dy .
fellow ra@@ pper , sno@@ op dog@@ g has had the name sno@@ op lion and of course the late music legend prince , changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as prince .

game of thr@@ ones star kit har@@ ington hits out at toxic mascul@@ inity
kit har@@ ington is known for his s@@ word@@ -@@ swinging role as jon snow in hbo 's violent medieval fantasy series game of thr@@ ones .
but the actor , 31 , has hit out at the stereo@@ type of the ma@@ cho hero , saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected .
speaking to the sunday times culture , kit said he believes ' something 's gone wrong ' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic mascul@@ inity in the # me@@ too era .
kit , who recently married his game of thr@@ ones co@@ -@@ star rose leslie , also 31 , admitted he feels ' quite strongly ' about addressing the issue .
'@@ i feel personally , quite strongly , at the moment - where have we gone wrong with mascul@@ inity ? , ' he said .
'@@ what have we been teaching men when they 're growing up , in terms of the problem we see now ? '
kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic mascul@@ inity thanks to its very masculine characters .
he continued : ' what 's innate and what 's taught ?
what is taught on tv , and in the streets , that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man ?
i think that 's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that ?
because clearly something has gone wrong for young men . '
in the interview he also admitted that he wouldn 't be doing any game of thr@@ ones pre@@ qu@@ els or sequ@@ els when the series comes to an end next summer , saying he is ' done with battle@@ fields and horses ' .
from november kit will star in a revival of sam she@@ pard 's true west which is the story of a film producer and his brother , who is a robber .
the actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife rose to be the best thing to come out of game of thr@@ ones .
'@@ i met my wife in this show , so in that way it gave me my future family , and my life from here on in , ' he said .
rose played y@@ gr@@ it@@ te , the love interest of kit 's character jon snow , in the em@@ my a@@ ward@@ -@@ winning fantasy series .
the couple married in june 2018 on the grounds of leslie 's family estate in scotland .
hiv / aids : china reports 14 % surge in new cases
china has announced a 14 % jump in the number of its citizens who are living with hiv and aids .
more than 8@@ 20,000 people are affected in the country , health officials say .
about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone .
the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex , marking a change from the past .
traditionally , hiv spread rapidly through some parts of china as a result of infected blood trans@@ fus@@ ions .
but the number of people contracting hiv in this way had been reduced to almost zero , chinese health officials said at a conference in yunnan province .
year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year , however , the number of those living with hiv and aids in china has risen by 100,000 people .
hiv transmission through sex is an acute issue in china 's l@@ g@@ bt community .
homo@@ sexuality was dec@@ ri@@ min@@ alised in china in 1997 , but discrimination against l@@ g@@ bt people is said to be ri@@ fe .
because of the country 's conservative values , studies have estimated that 70@@ -@@ 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women .
many of the trans@@ missions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protec@@ tions in these relationships .
since 2003 , china 's government has promised universal access to hiv medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue .
max@@ ine waters denies sta@@ ffer leaked go@@ p senators ' data , blasts ' dangerous lies ' and ' conspiracy the@@ ori@@ es@@ '
u.s. rep@@ . max@@ ine waters on saturday den@@ ounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three republican u.s. senators onto the lawmakers ' wikipedia pages .
the los angeles democrat asser@@ ted that the claims were being ped@@ aled by " ultra@@ -@@ right wing " pun@@ d@@ its and websites .
" lies , lies , and more despic@@ able lies , " waters said in a statement on twitter .
the released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for u.s. sen@@ s. lind@@ sey graham of south carolina , and mike lee and or@@ rin hatch , both of utah .
the information appeared online thursday , posted by an unknown person on capitol hill during a senate panel 's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh .
the leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh .
conservative sites such as gateway pun@@ dit and red@@ state reported that the ip address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with waters " office and released the information of a member of waters ' staff , the hill reported .
" this unfounded alleg@@ ation is completely false and an absolute lie , " waters continued .
" the member of my staff - whose identity , personal information , and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information .
this unfounded alleg@@ ation is completely false and an absolute lie . "
waters ' statement quickly drew criticism online , including from former white house press secretary ari fle@@ is@@ cher .
" this denial is angry , " fle@@ is@@ cher wrote .
" this suggests she doesn 't have the temper@@ ment to be a member of congress .
when someone is accused of something they didn 't do , they must not be angry .
they must not be de@@ fi@@ ant .
they must not question the motives of the accus@@ er .
they must be calm and se@@ rene . "
fle@@ is@@ cher was appearing to compare waters ' reaction to the democrats ' criticism of judge k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , who was accused by critics of seem@@ ing too angry during thursday 's hearing .
omar na@@ var@@ ro , a republican candidate running to un@@ seat waters in the mid@@ term elections , also voiced his thoughts on twitter .
" big if true , " he twee@@ ted .
in her statement , waters said her office had aler@@ ted " the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims .
" we will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed , " she continued , " and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destruc@@ tible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff . "
johnny english strikes again review - under@@ powered ro@@ wan at@@ kinson spy spo@@ of
it 's traditional now to look for brexit signific@@ ances in any new film with a british sl@@ ant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the johnny english action@@ -@@ comedy spo@@ of franchise - which started back in 2003 with johnny english and spl@@ ut@@ tered back to life in 2011 with johnny english reborn .
will ton@@ gu@@ e@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ cheek self@@ -@@ sa@@ tire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation 's new export opportunity ?
at any rate , the pop@@ -@@ eyed , rub@@ ber@@ -@@ faced incompetent johnny english has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his sign@@ alling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non@@ -@@ english@@ -@@ speaking c@@ ine@@ ma@@ going territories .
he is of course the daf@@ t secret agent who despite his bizarre preten@@ sions to smooth@@ ie glamour has got a little bit of clou@@ se@@ au , a dash of mr bean and a dol@@ lo@@ p of that cha@@ p contributing a single note to the char@@ i@@ ots of fire theme tune at the london 2012 olympics opening ceremony .
he 's also originally based on the travel@@ ler and international man of mystery at@@ kinson once played in the now forgotten bar@@ cla@@ y@@ card tv ads , leaving chaos in his wake .
there are one or two nice moments in this latest je outing .
i loved johnny english approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly cl@@ ang@@ ing against his helmet .
at@@ kinson 's gift for physical comedy is on display , but the humour feels pretty under@@ powered and weir@@ dly super@@ flu@@ ous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient .
the humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults , and for me johnny english 's w@@ ack@@ y mis@@ adventures aren 't as inven@@ tive and focused as at@@ kinson 's sil@@ ent@@ -@@ movie g@@ ag@@ s in the person@@ a of bean .
the perenni@@ ally top@@ ical premise now is that great britain is in serious trouble .
a cyber@@ -@@ hacker has infiltrated britain 's super@@ -@@ secret web network of spies , revealing the identities of all britain 's agents in the field , to the dis@@ may of the agent on duty - a regre@@ tt@@ ably small role for kevin el@@ don .
it 's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pom@@ p@@ ous and em@@ batt@@ led figure , already suffering a complete mel@@ tdown of political un@@ popularity : emma thompson does her very best with this qu@@ asi@@ -@@ tere@@ sa@@ -@@ may character but there 's nothing much in the script to work with .
her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised , she will have to bring someone out of retirement .
and that means bum@@ bling johnny english himself , now employed as a school@@ master in some pos@@ h establishment , but giving off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ record lessons in how to be an undercover operative : some nice g@@ ag@@ s here , as english offers a school of rock@@ -@@ type academy of spying .
english is whis@@ ked back to white@@ hall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long@@ -@@ suffering side@@ kick b@@ ough , played again by ben miller .
b@@ ough is now a married man , hit@@ ched to a submarine commander , a jol@@ ly@@ -@@ ho@@ c@@ key@@ -@@ sticks role in which v@@ ick@@ i pep@@ per@@ dine is a bit wasted .
so the batman and robin of getting things terribly wrong on her majesty 's secret service are back in action , encountering ol@@ ga kur@@ y@@ len@@ ko 's beautiful fe@@ m@@ me fat@@ ale op@@ hel@@ ia bulle@@ to@@ va .
meanwhile , the prime minister is falling danger@@ ously under the spell of the charis@@ matic tech billionaire who claims he can solve britain 's computer wo@@ es : the sinister jason vol@@ ta , played by jake l@@ acy .
english and b@@ ough begin their o@@ dys@@ sey of far@@ c@@ ical high@@ -@@ jin@@ ks : disguised as waiters , they set fire to a flash french restaurant ; they create may@@ hem smuggling themselves aboard vol@@ ta 's luxury yacht ; and english triggers pure an@@ archy as he attempts to use a virtual reality headset to famili@@ arise himself with the interior of vol@@ ta 's house .
all the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence , but as am@@ iable and bo@@ i@@ ster@@ ous as it is , there 's quite a bit of kids ' tv about the whole thing .
pretty moderate stuff .
and as with the other johnny english films i couldn 't help thinking : can 't the british film industry give ro@@ wan at@@ kinson a role that really does justice to his talent ?
labour denies it is de@@ vis@@ ing a plan for britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
jeremy cor@@ by@@ n 's labour party is to consider a radical plan which will see britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five .
the party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence ( ai ) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off .
it would see employees enjoy a three@@ -@@ day weekend - but still take home the same pay .
sources said the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers .
shifting to a four@@ -@@ day week has been endorsed by the trades union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .
a senior labour party source told the sunday times : ' a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .
'@@ it won 't happen overnight but a four@@ -@@ day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party 's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party 's overall industrial strategy . '
the labour party would not be the first to endorse such an idea , with the green party ple@@ dging a four@@ -@@ day working week during its 2017 general election campaign .
the aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the labour party as a whole , however .
a labour party spokesman said : ' a four@@ -@@ day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party . ' 
shadow chancellor john mc@@ don@@ nell used last week 's labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .
mr mc@@ don@@ nell said he was determined to claw back power from ' fac@@ eless directors ' and ' pro@@ fi@@ te@@ ers ' at utility firms .
the shadow chancellor 's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a labour government could make ' deduc@@ tions ' on the grounds of perceived wrong@@ doing .
he also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand 10 per cent of priv@@ ate@@ -@@ sector firms ' equity to employees , who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £ 500 .
lind@@ sey graham , john kennedy tell " 60 minutes " whether the fbi 's investigation of k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh could change their minds
the fbi investigation into accusations against judge bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the supreme court by at least a week , and raises the question of whether the bureau 's findings could sway any republican senators into pulling their support .
in an interview air@@ ing sunday , " 60 minutes " correspondent scott pel@@ ley asked republicans sen@@ s. john kennedy and lind@@ sey graham whether the fbi could un@@ earth anything that would lead them to change their minds .
kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from south carolina .
" i mean , of course , " said kennedy .
" i said going into the hearing , i said , i 've talked to judge k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh .
i called him after this happened , that alleg@@ ation came out , said , ' did you do it ? '
he was resolute , determined , un@@ equi@@ vocal . "
graham 's vote , however , appears set in stone .
" my mind 's made up about bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh and it would take a dynam@@ ite accusation , " he said .
" dr. ford , i don 't know what happened , but i know this : bre@@ tt denied it vigorously , " graham added , referring to christine blas@@ ey ford .
" and everybody she names couldn 't verify it .
it 's 36 years old .
i don 't see anything new changing . "
what is the global citizen festival and has it done anything to decrease poverty ?
this saturday new york will host the global citizen festival , an annual music event which has a hu@@ gely impressive line@@ -@@ up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission ; ending world poverty .
now in its seventh year , the global citizen festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to central park 's great lawn to not only enjoy acts such as janet jackson , car@@ di b and shawn men@@ des , but also to raise awareness for the event 's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 .
the global citizen festival , which stated in 2012 , is an extension of the global poverty project , an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .
in order to receive a free ticket for the event ( unless you were willing to pay for a vip ticket ) , concer@@ t@@ go@@ ers had to complete a series of tasks , or " actions " such volunte@@ ering , e@@ mailing a world leader , making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty .
but just how successful has global citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal ?
is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action , or just another case of so@@ -@@ called " cl@@ ick@@ tivism " - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet ?
since 2011 , global citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million " actions " from its supporters , pushing for a host of different goals .
it says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equ@@ ating to more than $ 37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.@@ 25 billion people by 2030 .
in early 2018 , the group cited 3@@ 90 commitments and announcements ste@@ mming from its actions , at least $ 10 billion of which have already been dis@@ bur@@ sed or fundra@@ ised .
the group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 6@@ 49 million people across the world .
some of the key commitments include the power of nutrition , a u.@@ k@@ . based partnership of investors and implem@@ enters committed to " helping children grow to their full potential , " promising to provide rwanda with $ 35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,@@ 700 twee@@ ts from global citizens .
" with support from the uk government , donors , national governments , and global citizens just like you , we can make the social injustice of under@@ nutrition a foot@@ note in history , " the power of nutrition ambassador trac@@ ey ul@@ l@@ man told the crowd during a live concert in london in april 2018 .
the group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the u.@@ k@@ . improve nutrition for mothers and children , the government announced funding for a project , the power of nutrition , that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions .
in response to one of the fa@@ q@@ s on its website asking " what makes you think we can end extreme poverty ? "
global citizen replied : " it 'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail .

us could use navy for " blockade " to ham@@ per russian energy exports - interior secretary
washington can " if necessary " resort to its navy to prevent russian energy hitting the markets , including in the middle east , us internal secretary ryan z@@ in@@ ke has revealed , as cited by washington examiner .
z@@ in@@ ke alleged that russia 's engagement in syria - notably , where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pre@@ text to explore new energy markets .
" i believe the reason they are in the middle east is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern europe , the southern belly of europe , " he has reportedly said .
and , according to to the official , there are ways and means to tackle it .
" the united states has that ability , with our navy , to make sure the sea lanes are open , and , if necessary , to blockade , to make sure that their energy does not go to market , " he said .
z@@ in@@ ke was addressing the atten@@ de@@ es of the event hosted by the consumer energy alliance , a non@@ -@@ profit group which styles itself as the " voice of the energy consumer " in the us .
he went to compare washington 's approaches to dealing with russia and iran , noting that they are effectively the same .
" the economic option on iran and russia is , more or less , lever@@ aging and replacing fuels , " he said , while referring to russia as a " one trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .
the statements come as trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to europe , replacing russia , the far cheaper option for european consumers .
for that effect , the trump administration officials , including us president donald trump himself , try to persuade germany to pull out of the " inappropriate " nor@@ d stream 2 pipeline project , which according to trump , made berlin moscow 's " captive . "
moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion nor@@ d stream 2 pipeline , which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .
the kremlin argues that washington 's fer@@ vent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition .
" i believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers , " russian energy minister al@@ ek@@ sand@@ r nov@@ ak said following a meeting with us energy secretary rick perry in moscow in september .
the us stance has drawn back@@ lash from germany , which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .
germany 's leading organization for industry , the federation of german industries ( b@@ di ) , has called on the us to stay away from the eu energy policy and the bilateral agreements between berlin and moscow .
" i have a big problem when a third state interfe@@ res in our energy supply , " die@@ ter k@@ emp@@ f , head of the federation of german industries ( b@@ di ) said following a recent meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin .
elizabeth warren will take " hard look " at running for president in 2020 , massachusetts senator says
massachusetts senator elizabeth warren said on saturday she would take a " hard look " at running for president following the mid@@ term elections .
during a town hall in hol@@ yo@@ ke , massachusetts , warren confirmed she 'd consider running .
" it 's time for women to go to washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to the hill .
" after november 6 , i will take a hard look at running for president . "
warren weighed in on president donald trump during the town hall , saying he was " taking this county in the wrong direction .
" i am worried down to my bones about what donald trump is doing to our democracy , " she said .
warren has been out@@ spoken in her criticism of trump and his supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh .
in a tweet on friday , warren said " of course we need an fbi investigation before voting . "
a poll released on thursday , however , showed a majority of warren 's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020 .
fif@@ ty@@ -@@ eight percent of " likely " massachusetts voters said the senator should not run , according to the suff@@ ol@@ k university political research center / boston globe poll .
thir@@ ty@@ -@@ two percent supported such a run .
the poll showed more support for a run by former governor de@@ val patrick , with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it .
other high profile democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former vice president joe biden and vermont senator ber@@ nie sanders .
biden said he would decide officially by january , the associated press reported .
sarah palin cites track palin 's p@@ ts@@ d at donald trump rally
track palin , 26 , spent a year in iraq after en@@ listing on sept .
he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on monday night
" what my own son is going through , what he is going through coming back , i can relate to other families who feel ra@@ mi@@ fications of p@@ ts@@ d and some of the w@@ oun@@ de@@ dness that our soldiers do return with , " she told the audience at a rally for donald trump in tul@@ sa , oklahoma .
palin called his arrest " the elephant in the room " and said of her son and other war veterans , " they come back a bit different , they come back hardened , they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and air@@ men , and every other member of the military , has given to the country .

18 states , d.@@ c@@ . support challenge to new asylum policy
eighteen states and the district of columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new u.s. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence .
representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ court brief friday in washington to support an as@@ yl@@ um@@ -@@ seeker challenging the policy , nbc news reported .
the full name of the plaintiff in the grace v@@ . sessions suit that the american civil liber@@ ties union filed in august against the federal policy has not been revealed .
she said her partner " and his violent gang member sons , " abused her but u.s. officials denied her request for asylum july 20 .
she was detained in texas .
the states ' attor@@ neys supporting grace described el salvador , hondur@@ as and guatemala , which produce a large number of applicants for u.s. asylum , as nations facing per@@ vas@@ ive problems with gangs and domestic violence .
the new u.s. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the board of immigrant appeals that allowed un@@ documented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum .
district of columbia attorney general karl rac@@ ine said in a statement friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state , federal , and international law . "
" federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjud@@ icated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim , and such a bar violates that principle , " the friend@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the court brief said .
attor@@ neys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the u.s. economy , saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and " supply necessary labor . "
attorney general jeff sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in june .
" asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race , religion , nationality , or membership in a particular social group or political opinion , " sessions said in his june 11 announcement of the policy .
asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -@@ - even all serious problems -@@ - that people face every day all over the world .

u.s. ambassador ac@@ cuses china of ' bullying ' with ' propaganda ad@@ s@@ '
a week after an official chinese newspaper ran a four@@ -@@ page ad in a u.s. daily tou@@ ting the mutual benefits of u.@@ s.@@ -@@ china trade , the u.s. ambassador to china accused beijing of using the american press to spread propaganda .
u.s. president donald trump last wednesday referred to the china daily 's paid supplement in the des mo@@ ines register - the state of iowa 's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing china of seeking to med@@ dle in the nov@@ . 6 u.s. congressional elections , a charge china denies .
trump 's accusation that beijing was trying to med@@ dle in u.s. elections marked what u.s. officials told reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by washington to put pressure on china .
while it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade , beijing and washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other 's imports .
china 's retali@@ atory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as iowa that supported trump 's republican party , chinese and u.s. experts have said .
terry bran@@ st@@ ad , the u.s. ambassador to china and the former long@@ time governor of iowa , a major exporter of agricultural goods to china , said beijing had hurt american workers , farmers and businesses .
china , bran@@ st@@ ad wrote in an opinion piece in sunday 's des mo@@ ines register , " is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press . "
" in dissemin@@ ating its propaganda , china 's government is avail@@ ing itself of america 's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the des mo@@ ines register , " bran@@ st@@ ad wrote .
" in contrast , at the newsstand down the street here in beijing , you will find limited dis@@ sen@@ ting voices and will not see any true reflection of the dispar@@ ate opinions that the chinese people may have on china 's trou@@ bling economic trajectory , given that media is under the firm thumb of the chinese communist party , " he wrote .
he added that " one of china 's most prominent newspapers do@@ dged the offer to publish " his article , although he did not say which newspaper .
republicans alien@@ ating women voters ahead of mid@@ terms with k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh de@@ bac@@ le , analysts warn
as many top republicans stand@@ -@@ by and defend supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault , analyst have warned they will see a back@@ lash , particularly from women , during the upcoming mid@@ term elections .
the emotions surrounding this have been extremely high , and most republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote .
those things can 't be walked back , " grant re@@ e@@ her , a professor of political science at sy@@ rac@@ use university 's maxwell school told the hill for an article published saturday .
re@@ e@@ her said he doubts senator jeff flake 's ( r@@ -@@ arizona ) last@@ -@@ minute push for an fbi investigation will be enough to plac@@ ate angry voters .
" women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in november , " kar@@ ine je@@ an@@ -@@ pierre , a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group move@@ on said on friday , according to the washington , d.@@ c@@ . newspaper .
on friday morning , prote@@ stors chan@@ ted " november is coming ! " as they demonstrated in the hallway of the senate as the republicans controlling the judiciary committee chose to move forward with k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's nomination despite the testimony of dr. christine blas@@ ey ford , mic reported .
" democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart , " stu ro@@ then@@ berg , a non@@ partisan political analyst , told the news site .
" people are saying it 's already been high ; that 's true .
but it could be higher , particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters , 18@@ - to 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds , who while they don 't like the president , often don 't vote . "
even before ford 's public testimony deta@@ iling her allegations of sexual assault against the supreme court nominee , analysts suggested a back@@ lash could follow if republicans pushed forward with the confirmation .
" this has become a mud@@ dled mess for the go@@ p , " said michael ste@@ ele , former chairman of the republican national committee , early last week , according to nbc news .
" it 's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh is put on the bench , it 's also about the way republicans have handled this and how they have treated her , " guy cec@@ il , director of priorities usa , a group that helps to elect democrats , pointed out to the news channel .
however , americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of ford 's and k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's testi@@ mon@@ ies , with slightly more si@@ ding with the latter .
a new poll from you@@ go@@ v shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed ford 's testimony , while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh .
additionally , 38 percent said they thought k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony , while just 30 percent said the same about ford .
after the push from flake , the fbi is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by ford as well as at least one other accus@@ er , de@@ bor@@ ah ra@@ mi@@ re@@ z , the guardian reported .
ford testified before the senate judiciary committee under oath last week that k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh drun@@ kenly assaulted her at the age of 17 .
ra@@ mi@@ re@@ z al@@ leges that the supreme court nominee exposed his genit@@ als to her while they attended a party during their time studying at yale in the 198@@ 0@@ s .
the inventor of the world wide web plans to start a new internet to take on google and facebook
tim ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee , the inventor of the world wide web , is launching a startup that seeks to rival facebook , amazon and google .
the technology legend 's latest project , in@@ rupt , is a company that builds off of ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee 's open source platform solid .
solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information .
in an exclusive interview with fast company , ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee joked that the intent behind in@@ rupt is " world domination . "
" we have to do it now , " he said of the startup .
" it 's a historical moment . "
the app uses solid 's technology to allow people to create their own " personal online data store " or a pod .
it can contain contact lists , to@@ -@@ do lists , calendar , music library and other personal and professional tools .
it 's like google drive , microsoft outlook , slack and spo@@ tify are all available on one browser and all at the same time .
what 's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information .
the company calls it " personal empowerment through data . "
the idea for in@@ rupt , according to the company 's ceo john bruce , is for the company to bring resources , process and appropriate skills to help make solid available to everyone .
the company currently consists of ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee , bruce , a security platform bought by ibm , some on@@ -@@ staff developers contracted to work on the project , and a community of volunteer co@@ ders .
starting this week , technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the in@@ rupt website .
ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee said that he and his team are not talking to " facebook and google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely u@@ pen@@ ded overnight .
" we are not asking their permission . "
in a post on medium published on saturday , ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee wrote that in@@ rupt 's " mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid . "
in 1994 , ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee transformed the internet when he established the world wide web consortium at massachusetts institute of technology .
in recent months , ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate .
even while launching in@@ rupt , ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee will remain the founder and director of world wide web consortium , the web foundation and the open data institute .
" i 'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web , " ber@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ lee added .
bernard van@@ n : ww@@ 1 victoria cross cler@@ ic celebrated
the only church of england cler@@ ic to win a victoria cross during world war one as a comb@@ at@@ ant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on .
lt col the reverend bernard van@@ n won the award on 29 september 19@@ 18 in the attack at bel@@ leng@@ lis@@ e and le@@ ha@@ uc@@ our@@ t .
however , he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest british military honour .
a commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grand@@ sons at a parade in ru@@ sh@@ den , north@@ amp@@ ton@@ shire , on saturday .
one of his grand@@ sons , michael van@@ n , said it was " brilli@@ antly symbolic " the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather 's a@@ ward@@ -@@ winning feat .
according to the london gaz@@ ette , on 29 september 19@@ 18 lt col van@@ n led his battalion across the canal de sa@@ int@@ -@@ qu@@ entin " through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns . "
he later rushed up to the firing line and with the " greatest gall@@ antry " led the line forward before rushing a field@@ -@@ gun single@@ -@@ handed and knocked out three of the detachment .
lt col van@@ n was killed by a german sniper on 4 october 19@@ 18 - just over a month before the war ended .
michael van@@ n , 72 , said his grandfather 's actions were " something that i know that i could never live up to but something which is hum@@ bling . "
he and his brother dr james van@@ n also laid a wreath after the parade , which was led by the bren@@ tw@@ ood imperial youth band .
michael van@@ n said he was " feeling very hon@@ oured to play a part in the parade " and added " the val@@ our of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people . "
mma fans stayed up all night to watch bell@@ ator 20@@ 6 , they got pe@@ pp@@ a pig instead
imagine this , you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed bell@@ ator 20@@ 6 only to be denied watching the main event .
the bill from san jose contained 13 fights , including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the uk on channel 5 .
at 6@@ am , just as ge@@ g@@ ard m@@ ous@@ asi and r@@ ory mac@@ donald were preparing to face each other , viewers in the uk were left stunned when the coverage changed to pe@@ pp@@ a pig .
some were un@@ impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight .
one fan on twitter described the switch to the children 's cartoon as " some sort of sick joke . "
" it 's government regulation that at 6 a.@@ m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children 's programming , " said dave schwar@@ tz , bell@@ ator senior vice president of marketing and communication , when asked about the transmission .
" " pe@@ pp@@ a the pig , " yes . "
bell@@ ator company president scott co@@ ker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include uk viewers in the future .
" i think that when i think about the re@@ play , i think that we can probably work it out , " co@@ ker said .
" but it 's six in the morning on a sunday there and we won 't be able to work this out until sunday our time , monday their time .
but we are working on it .
believe me , when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly .
we were trying to fix it , we thought it was a technical glit@@ ch .
but it wasn 't , it was a governmental issue .
i can promise you the next time it 's not going to happen .
we 'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to over@@ deliver for the fans and we just went over .
it 's an unfortunate situation . "
desert island discs : tom dal@@ ey felt ' inferior ' over sexuality
olympic diver tom dal@@ ey says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .
the 24@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that " not everyone is like me . "
speaking on the first radio 4 desert island discs presented by lauren la@@ ver@@ ne , he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others " hope . "
he also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the olympics .
the regular pres@@ enter of the long@@ -@@ running show , kir@@ sty young , has taken a number of months off because of illness .
appearing as a ca@@ sta@@ way on la@@ ver@@ ne 's first programme , dal@@ ey said he felt " less than " everyone else growing up because " it wasn 't socially acceptable to like boys and girls . "
he said : " to this day , those feelings of feeling less than , and feeling different , have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed . "
he wanted to prove that he was " something , " he said , so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality .
the two@@ -@@ time bronze olympic med@@ all@@ ist has become a high@@ -@@ profile l@@ g@@ bt campaig@@ ner and used his appearance at this year 's commonwealth games in australia to appeal for more countries to dec@@ ri@@ min@@ alise homo@@ sexuality .
he said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ra@@ mi@@ fications and wanted to give others " hope . "
the three@@ -@@ time world champion said falling in love with a man - us film@@ -@@ maker dus@@ tin lance black , who he met in 2013 - " caught me by surprise . "
dal@@ ey married the oscar winner , who is 20 years his senior , last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue .
" when you go through so much at such a young age " - he went to his first olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows .
the couple became parents in june , to a son called robert ray black@@ -@@ dal@@ ey , and dal@@ ey said his " whole perspective " had changed .
" if you had asked me last year , it was all about ' i need to win a gold medal ' , " he said .
" you know what , there are bigger things than olympic gold medals .
my olympic gold medal is robbie . "
his son has the same name as his father robert , who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer .
dal@@ ey said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for london 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row .
" i couldn 't say to him ' you 're not going to be around to be on the front row dad ' , " he said .
" i was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn 't until he 'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that i finally acknowledged he wasn 't invincible , " he said .
the following year dal@@ ey competed at the 2012 olympics and won bronze .
" i just knew that this is what i had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an olympic games , there was no better feeling , " he said .
it also inspired his first song choice - proud by heather small - which had reson@@ ated with him in the build up to the olympics and still gave him goo@@ se@@ bumps .
desert island discs is on bbc radio 4 on sunday at 11 : 15 b@@ st .
out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ form mic@@ kel@@ son ben@@ ched on ry@@ der cup saturday
american phil mic@@ kel@@ son will set a record on sunday when he plays his 47@@ th ry@@ der cup match , but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone .
mic@@ kel@@ son , playing in the bi@@ ennial event for a record 12@@ th time , was ben@@ ched by captain jim fur@@ y@@ k for saturday 's four@@ balls and four@@ somes .
instead of being at the center of the action , as he so often has been for the united states , the five@@ -@@ times major winner split his day between being a cheer@@ leader and working on his game on the range in the hope of recti@@ fying what ails him .
never the straigh@@ test of drivers even at the peak of his career , the 48@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old is not an ideal fit for the tight le golf national course , where the long rough routinely pun@@ ishes err@@ ant shots .
and if the course on its own is not daunting enough , mic@@ kel@@ son , in the ninth match on sunday , faces accurate british open champion franc@@ esco mol@@ in@@ ari , who has teamed up with rookie tommy fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood to win all four of their matches this week .
if the americans , four points down starting the 12 singles matches , get off to a hot start , mic@@ kel@@ son 's match could prove absolutely crucial .
fur@@ y@@ k expressed confidence in his man , not that he could say much else .
" he fully understood the role that he had today , gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " fur@@ y@@ k said .
" he 's got a lot of confidence in himself .
he 's a hall of fam@@ er and he 's added so much to these teams in the past , and this week .
i probably didn 't en@@ vision him playing two matches .
i en@@ visi@@ oned more , but that 's the way it worked out and that 's the way we thought we had to go .
he wants to be out there , just like everyone else . "
mic@@ kel@@ son will pass nick fal@@ do 's record for the most ry@@ der cup matches played on sunday .
it could mark the end of a ry@@ der cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record .
mic@@ kel@@ son has 18 wins , 20 losses and seven hal@@ ves , though fur@@ y@@ k said his presence brought some in@@ tang@@ i@@ bles to the team .
" he 's funny , he 's sarcas@@ tic , witty , likes to poke fun at people , and he 's a great guy to have in the team room , " he explained .
" i think the younger players had fun having a go at him , as well , this week , which was fun to see .
he provides a lot more than just play . "
europe captain thomas b@@ jor@@ n knows big lead can soon disappear
thomas b@@ jor@@ n , the european captain , knows from experience that a si@@ ze@@ able lead heading into the last@@ -@@ day singles in the ry@@ der cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride .
the dane made his debut in the 1997 match at val@@ der@@ ra@@ ma , where a side cap@@ tained by se@@ ve bal@@ le@@ ster@@ os held a five@@ -@@ point advantage over the americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narro@@ west of margins , winning 14 ½ -@@ 13 ½ .
" you keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at val@@ der@@ ra@@ ma ; we had a big lead at brook@@ line , where we lost , and at val@@ der@@ ra@@ ma , where we won , but only just , " said b@@ jor@@ n , pictured , after watching the class of 2018 win 5@@ -@@ 3 both on friday and yesterday to lead 10@@ -@@ 6 at le golf national .
so history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over .
you go full bore tomorrow .
get out there and do all the right things .
this is not over till you 've got the points on the board .
we have a goal , and that is to try to win this trophy , and that 's where the focus stays .
i 've said all along , i focus on the 12 players that are in our side , but we are so well aware of what 's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world . "
delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course , b@@ jor@@ n added : " i would never get ahead of myself in this .
tomorrow 's a different beast .
tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward , and that is a different thing to do .
it 's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good , but when you 're out there individually , then you 're tested to the full of your capacity as a gol@@ fer .
that 's the message that you need to get across to players , is get the best out of yourself tomorrow .
now , you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself , as well . "
in contrast to b@@ jor@@ n , opposite number jim fur@@ y@@ k will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners , the exceptions being jordan sp@@ ie@@ th and justin thomas , who picked up three points out of four .
fur@@ y@@ k himself has been on both ends of those big last@@ -@@ day tur@@ nar@@ ounds , having been part of the winning team at brook@@ line before ending up a loser as europe pulled off the " miracle at me@@ din@@ ah . "
" i remember every damn word of it , " he said in reply to being asked how ben c@@ ren@@ shaw , the captain in 1999 , had r@@ allied his players heading into the last day .
" we have 12 important matches tomorrow , but you 'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at brook@@ line , like you saw at me@@ din@@ ah .
when that momentum gets going one way , it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches .
we set up our line@@ -@@ up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like , you know , we 're trying to make some magic tomorrow . "
thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the figh@@ t@@ back and faces r@@ ory mc@@ il@@ roy in the top match , with paul casey , justin rose , jon ra@@ hm , tommy fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood and ian poul@@ ter the other europeans in the top half of the order .
" i went with this group of guys in this order because i think it covers all the way through , " said b@@ jor@@ n of his singles selec@@ tions .
germany 's new warship postponed yet again
german navy 's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing cold war@@ -@@ era warships , but it won 't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snow@@ ball@@ ing cost , local media reported .
commissioning of the " rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ p@@ fal@@ z , " the lead ship of the brand new bad@@ en@@ -@@ wu@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ -@@ class fri@@ gates , has now been postponed until the first half of 2019 , according to die ze@@ it newspaper citing a military spokesman .
the vessel should have joined the navy in 2014 , but the trou@@ bling post@@ -@@ delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project .
the four bad@@ en@@ -@@ wu@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ -@@ class vessels the navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing bre@@ men@@ -@@ class fri@@ gates .
it is understood they will feature a powerful cannon , an array of anti@@ -@@ aircraft and anti@@ -@@ ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .
other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest fri@@ gates for up to two years away from home ports .
however , continuous delays mean that the cu@@ tting@@ -@@ edge warships - said to allow germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service , die ze@@ it notes .
the ill@@ -@@ f@@ ated f@@ 125 frigate made headlines last year , when the german navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to blo@@ hm & vo@@ ss shipyard in hamburg .
this was the first time the navy has returned a ship to a ship@@ builder after delivery .
little was known about the reasons behind the return , but german media cited a number of crucial " software and hardware defects " that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission .
software deficiencies were particularly important as the bad@@ en@@ -@@ wu@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ -@@ class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older bre@@ men class fri@@ gates .
also , it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the navy 's ability to add future upgrades .
the 7,@@ 000@@ -@@ ton " rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ p@@ fal@@ z " is believed to be twice as heavy as simil@@ ar@@ -@@ class ships used by the germans in the second world war .
aside from faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue .
it is said to have reached staggering € 3.@@ 1@@ billion ( $ 3.@@ 6@@ bn ) - up from initial € 2.2 billion .
problems gri@@ pping the newest fri@@ gates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that germany 's naval power is shrinking .
earlier this year , h@@ ans@@ -@@ peter bar@@ te@@ ls , chief of the german parliament 's defense committee , acknowledged the navy is actually " running out of deplo@@ ym@@ ent@@ -@@ capable ships . "
the official said the issue has snow@@ ball@@ ed over time , because old ships were decom@@ mis@@ si@@ oned but no replacement vessels were provided .
he lam@@ ented that none of the of the bad@@ en@@ -@@ wu@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ -@@ class fri@@ gates were able to join the navy .
national trust eaves@@ drops on secret life of bats
new research being carried out at an estate in the scottish high@@ lands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food .
it is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities .
the study by scientists at the national trust for scotland will follow common and sop@@ ran@@ o pi@@ pi@@ stre@@ ll@@ es as well as brown long@@ -@@ e@@ ared and dau@@ bent@@ on bats at inve@@ re@@ we gardens in w@@ ester ross .
special recor@@ ders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season .
n@@ hs staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand@@ -@@ held detectors .
expert sound analysis of all recordings will as@@ certain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what .
a habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landsc@@ ap@@ e@@ -@@ scale picture of their behaviour .
rob de@@ war , nature conservation adviser for n@@ ts , hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species .
this information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain wood@@ lands for bats and other associated species .
bat populations in scotland and across the uk have declined considerably over the past century .
they are under threat from building and development work that affects roo@@ sts and loss of habitat .
wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as can fly@@ papers and some chemical treatments of building materials , as well as attacks by pet cats .
bats are not actually blind .
however , due to their noc@@ tur@@ nal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey .
they use a sophisticated echo@@ -@@ location technique to pin@@ point bugs and obstacles in their flight path .
the n@@ ts , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 7@@ 6,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously .
it has ten trained experts , who regularly carry out surveys , roo@@ st inspections and sometimes rescu@@ es .
the organisation has even set up scotland 's first and only dedicated bat reserve at threa@@ ve estate in dum@@ fries and gallo@@ way , which is home to eight of scotland 's ten bat species .
estate manager david thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them .
" here at threa@@ ve we have a great area for bats , " he said .
" we 've got the old buildings , lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat .
but there is much about bats that is still unknown , so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive . "
he stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible un@@ wit@@ ting destruction of a single maternity roo@@ st could kill up to 400 females and young , possibly wiping out an entire local population .
bats are protected and it is illegal to kill , har@@ ass or disturb them or destroy their roo@@ sts .
el@@ is@@ abeth fer@@ rell , scottish officer for the bat conservation trust , has encouraged the public to pitch in to help .
she said : " we still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don 't know how their populations are f@@ aring . "
ronaldo dis@@ misses rape claims as lawyers set to sue german magazine
cris@@ tian@@ o ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news , " saying that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .
his lawyers are set to sue german news magazine der sp@@ ie@@ gel , which published the allegations .
the portugal and juventus forward has been accused of ra@@ ping an american woman , named as ka@@ thr@@ yn may@@ org@@ a , in a las vegas hotel room in 2009 .
he is alleged to have then paid her $ 37@@ 5,000 to keep quiet about the incident , der sp@@ ie@@ gel reported on friday .
speaking in an instagram live video to his 14@@ 2 million followers hours after the claims were reported , ronaldo , 33 , slammed the reports as " fake news . "
" no , no , no , no , no .
what they said today , fake news , " the five@@ -@@ time ball@@ on d '@@ or winner says into the camera .
" they want to promote themselves by using my name .
it 's normal .
they want to be famous to say my name , but it is part of the job .
i am a happy man and all good , " the player added , smiling .
ronaldo 's lawyers are preparing to sue der sp@@ ie@@ gel over the allegations , which they have called " an in@@ ad@@ missible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy , " according to reuters .
lawyer christian sch@@ er@@ tz said the player would seek compensation for " moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . "
the alleged incident is said to have taken place in june 2009 at a suite at the palms hotel and casino in las vegas .
after meeting in a nightclub , ronaldo and may@@ org@@ a reportedly went back to the player 's room , where he allegedly an@@ ally raped her , according to papers filed at clark county district court in nevada .
may@@ org@@ a claims ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was " 99 percent " a " good guy " let down by the " one percent . "
the documents claim that ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex , but that it was consen@@ su@@ al .
may@@ org@@ a also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital , but later agreed to an out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ court settlement because she felt " terrified of retaliation " and was worried about " being publicly humiliated . "
the 34@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old says she is now seeking to over@@ turn the settlement as she continues to be tra@@ uma@@ tized by the alleged incident .
ronaldo was on the verge of joining real madrid from manchester united at the time of the alleged assault , and this summer moved to italian giants ju@@ ve in a € 100 million deal .
brexit : uk ' would forever regret ' losing carmakers
the uk " would regret it forever " if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after brexit , business secretary greg clark has said .
he added it was " concerning " that toyota uk had told the bbc that if britain left the eu without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in bur@@ na@@ ston , near derby .
" we need a deal , " mr clark said .
the japanese car@@ maker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no@@ -@@ deal brexit could cost jobs .
the bur@@ na@@ ston plant - which makes toyota 's aur@@ is and aven@@ sis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the european union .
" my view is that if britain crashes out of the eu at the end of march we will see production stops in our factory , " said mar@@ vin coo@@ ke , toyota 's managing director at bur@@ na@@ ston .
other uk car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the eu without agreement on how cross@@ -@@ border trade will function , including honda , bmw and jaguar land rover .
bmw , for example , says it will close its mini plant in oxford for a month following brexit .
the main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no@@ -@@ deal brexit .
toyota 's production line is run on a " just@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ time " basis , with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the uk and the eu for cars made to order .
if the uk leaves the eu without a deal on 29 march , there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts .
it would be impossible for toyota to hold more than a day 's worth of inventory at its der@@ by@@ shire plant , the company said , and so production would be stopped .
mr clark said the@@ resa may 's che@@ qu@@ ers plan for future relations with the eu is " precisely cali@@ bra@@ ted to avoid those checks at the border . "
" we need to have a deal . we want to have the best deal that will allow as i say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" the evidence from not just toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains . "
toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped , but in the longer term , warned that added costs would reduce the plant 's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs .
peter t@@ sou@@ v@@ all@@ aris , who has worked at bur@@ na@@ ston for 24 years and is the unite union conven@@ or at the plant , said his members are increasingly concerned : " in my experience once these jobs go they never come back .
a government spokesperson said : " we have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the eu . "
trump meeting with rosen@@ stein may be delayed again , says white house
donald trump 's high@@ -@@ stakes meeting with deputy attorney general rod rosen@@ stein could be " pushed back another week " as the fight over supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh continues , the white house said on sunday .
rosen@@ stein over@@ sees the work of special counsel robert mu@@ eller , who is investigating russian election interference , links between trump a@@ ides and russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president .
whether or not trump will fire the deputy attorney general , and thereby endanger mu@@ eller 's independence , has fu@@ elled washington gossip for months .
earlier this month , the new york times reported that rosen@@ stein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25@@ th amendment .
rosen@@ stein denied the report .
but last monday he went to the white house , amid reports he was about to resign .
instead , a meeting with trump , who was then at the united nations in new york , was announced for thursday .
trump said he would " prefer not " to fire rosen@@ stein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the senate judiciary committee hearing in which k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct , dr christine blas@@ ey ford , both testified .
on friday , trump ordered a one@@ -@@ week fbi investigation of claims against k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , further delaying a full senate vote .
trump 's press secretary , sarah sanders , appeared on fox news sunday .
asked about the rosen@@ stein meeting , she said : " a date for that hasn 't been set , it could be this week , i could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court .
but we 'll see and i always like to keep the press updated . "
some reporters would contest that assertion : sanders has not held a white house press briefing since 10 september .
host chris wallace asked why .
sanders said the scarcity of brief@@ ings was not due to a di@@ sta@@ ste for tv reporters " grand@@ standing , " although she said : " i won 't disagree with the fact that they grand@@ stand . "
she then suggested direct contact between trump and the press will increase .
" the president does more q & a sessions than any president has prior to him , " she said , adding without citing evidence : " we 've looked at those numbers . "
brief@@ ings will still happen , sanders said , but " if the press has the chance to ask the president of the united states questions directly , that 's infinitely better than talking to me .
we try to do that a lot and you 've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that 's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the united states . "
trump regularly takes questions when leaving the white house or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dign@@ it@@ aries .
solo press conferences are rare .
in new york this week the president perhaps demonstrated why , making a free@@ whe@@ eling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters .
health secretary writes to eu workers at n@@ hs scotland over brexit fears
the health secretary has written to eu staff working in scotland 's n@@ hs to express the country 's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post@@ -@@ brexit .
je@@ ane fre@@ eman ms@@ p sent a letter with less than six months to go until the uk with@@ draws from the eu .
the scottish government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for eu citizens working in its de@@ vol@@ ved public services .
in her letter , ms fre@@ eman wrote : " over the summer , negotiations between the uk and eu on withdrawal have continued , heading towards expected decisions this autumn .
but the uk government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no@@ -@@ deal scenario .
i know this must be a very un@@ settling time for all of you .
that is why i wanted to reiter@@ ate now how much i value the contribution of every member of staff , regardless of their nationality .
colleagues from across the eu , and beyond , bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service , and benefit the patients and communities we serve .
scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here . "

tennessee state tigers line@@ back@@ er chris@@ tion aber@@ cro@@ m@@ bie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in saturday 's 3@@ 1@@ -@@ 27 defeat to the v@@ ander@@ bil@@ t com@@ mo@@ do@@ res , the tennes@@ sean 's mike organ reported .

foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the uk
foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the uk with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new tory plans
the move will neutr@@ alise the success of cor@@ by@@ n 's drive to attract young voters
the stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the uk
the treasury expects it raise up to £ 120 million a year@@ - to help the homeless
foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the uk - with the extra cash used to help the homeless , the@@ resa may will announce today .
the move will be seen as an attempt to neutr@@ alise the success of jeremy cor@@ by@@ n 's drive to attract young voters with ple@@ dges to provide more affordable housing and target high ear@@ ners .
the stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the uk , with the extra money boosting the government 's drive to combat rough sleeping .
the sur@@ charge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty , including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ lets - could be as much as three per cent .
the treasury expects the move to raise up to £ 120 million a year .
an estimated 13 per cent of new@@ -@@ build london properties are bought by non@@ -@@ uk residents , driving up prices and making it harder for first@@ -@@ time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder .
many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become " ghost towns " because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country .
the new policy comes just weeks after boris johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home .
he accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snap@@ ping up land but not using it , and urged mrs may to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix britain 's " housing disgrace . "
mr cor@@ by@@ n has announced an eye@@ -@@ catching series of proposed housing reforms , including rent controls and an end to " no@@ -@@ fault " ev@@ ic@@ tions .
he also wants to give counc@@ ils greater powers to build new homes .
mrs may said : " last year i said i would dedicate my premi@@ ership to restoring the british dream - that life should be better for each new generation .
and that means fixing our broken housing market .
britain will always be open to people who want to live , work and build a life here .
however , it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don 't live in the uk , as well as foreign@@ -@@ based companies , to buy homes as hard@@ -@@ working british residents .
for too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant , and the indign@@ ity of rough sleeping remains all too real . "
jack ross : ' my ultimate ambition is to manage scot@@ land@@ '
s@@ under@@ land boss jack ross says his " ultimate ambition " is to become the scotland manager at some stage .
the sco@@ t , 42 , is re@@ lis@@ hing the challenge of revi@@ ving the north@@ -@@ east club , who currently sit third place in league one , three points off the top .
he moved to the stadium of light this summer after guiding st mir@@ ren back to the scottish premi@@ ership last season .
" i wanted to play for my country as a player .
i got a b cap and that was it , " ross told bbc scotland 's sport@@ sound .
" but i grew up watching scotland at hamp@@ den a lot with my dad as a kid , and it is always something that has drawn me back .
that opportunity would only come , though , if i am successful in club management . "
ross 's predecessors as s@@ under@@ land manager include dick advoca@@ at , david mo@@ yes , sam all@@ ar@@ dy@@ ce , martin o 'neill , roy ke@@ ane , gus po@@ yet and paulo di can@@ io .
the former allo@@ a athletic boss says he felt no tre@@ p@@ idation in following such established names at such a big club , having previously rejected over@@ tures from bar@@ n@@ sley and ip@@ sw@@ ich town .
" success for me at the moment will be gau@@ ged by ' can i return this club to the premier league ? '
because of the structure and facilities at this club , it undoubtedly belongs in the premier league , " he said .
" it is not an easy task to get it there , but i would probably only view myself as being successful here if i can get the club back there . "
ross is only three years into his management career , after a period as assistant boss at dum@@ bar@@ ton and a 15@@ -@@ month spell on hearts ' coaching staff .
he then helped allo@@ a recover from re@@ leg@@ ation to the third tier , and transformed st mir@@ ren from the brink of re@@ leg@@ ation to championship title winners the following season .
and ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at cly@@ de , har@@ tle@@ pool , fal@@ kirk , st mir@@ ren and hamilton academ@@ ical .
" it was probably a real crossroads , " he recalled , of taking charge of allo@@ a .
" i genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me , more so than playing .
it sounds bizarre because i did okay , made a reasonable living out of it , and enjoyed some reasonable highs .
but playing can be tough .
there are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis .
i still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right .
i always wanted to manage and now i am doing it , it feels the most comfortable i have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life . "

perfect time for a p@@ int is 5.@@ 30@@ pm on a saturday , survey finds
the summer heat@@ wave has boosted ta@@ kings for britain 's struggling pub@@ s but he@@ aped more pressure on restaurant chains .
pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in july - but ta@@ kings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent , figures revealed .
peter martin , of business consultancy c@@ ga , which compiled the figures , said : " continued sunshine and england 's longer than expected participation in the world cup meant july followed a similar pattern to the previous month of june , when pub@@ s were up 2.8 per cent , except that restaurants were hit even harder .
the fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in june just got worse in july .
drin@@ k@@ -@@ led pub@@ s and bars performed by far the strongest with like@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ likes up more than restaurants were down .
food@@ -@@ led pub@@ s also suffered in the sun , although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators .
it seems people just wanted to go out for a drink .
across managed pub@@ s and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month , with food down three per cent . "
paul new@@ man , of leisure and hospitality analysts r@@ sm said : " these results continue the trend we 've seen since the end of april .
weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ home market .
it comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle , albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures .
the long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food@@ -@@ led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we 've experienced in august will provide some much@@ -@@ needed resp@@ ite . "
total sales growth across pub and restaurants , including new openings , was 2.7 per cent in july , reflecting the slow down in brand roll@@ -@@ outs .
the coff@@ er peach tracker industry sales monitor for the uk pub , bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups , with a combined turnover of over £ 9 billion , and is the established industry benchmark .

breast pump adver@@ t comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
a breast pump company has divided opinion online with an adver@@ t that compares nursing mothers to cows being mil@@ ked .
to mark the launch of what is said to be the " world 's first silent wearable breast bump , " consumer tech company el@@ vie released a ton@@ gu@@ e@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ cheek music video@@ -@@ inspired adver@@ t to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers .
four real mothers dance in a hay@@ -@@ filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like : " yes , i milk myself , but you don 't see no tail " and " in case you hadn 't noticed these are not ud@@ ders , they 're my boobs . "
the chorus continues : " pump it out , pump it out , i 'm feeding them babies , pump it out , pump it out , i 'm mil@@ king my ladies . "
however , the adver@@ t , which has been published on the firm 's facebook page , has caused controversy online .
with 7@@ 7,000 views and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , with many saying it makes light of the " hor@@ r@@ ors " of the dairy industry .
" very poor decision using cows to advertise this product .
like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk , except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth , " one wrote .
the el@@ vie breast pump fits discre@@ e@@ tly inside a nursing bra ( el@@ vie / mother )
another commented : " understand@@ ably traumatic for both mother and baby .
but yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies ? "
someone else added : " such an out of touch adver@@ t . "
others defended the adver@@ t , with one woman admitting that she found the song " hilarious . "
" i think this is a genus idea .
i would 've had one if i was still breastfeeding .
pumping made me feel exactly like a cow .
the adver@@ t is a little mad but i took it for what it was .
this is a genius product , " one wrote .
another commented : " this is a fun adver@@ t aimed at m@@ ums who pump ( often in their work@@ places or toilets ) and feel like " cows . "
this is not an adver@@ t praising or judging the dairy industry . "
at the end of the video the group of women reveal they 've all been dancing with the discre@@ et pumps tuc@@ ked in their bras .
the concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast@@ -@@ pump say they feel like cows .
the el@@ vie pump however , is completely silent , has no wires or tubes and fits discre@@ e@@ tly inside a nursing bra , giving women the freedom to move , hold their babies , and even go out while pumping .
ana bal@@ ar@@ in , partner and ec@@ d at mother commented : " the el@@ vie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch .
by drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight , while demonstrating in an entertaining and rel@@ atable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .
this is not the first time the el@@ vie pump has made the headlines .
during london fashion week , a mother of two appeared on the cat@@ walk for designer mar@@ ta ja@@ ku@@ bow@@ ski while using the product .
hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the texas border
the number of detained migrant children has spi@@ ked even though monthly border cross@@ ings have remained relatively unchanged , in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors .
traditionally , most sponsors have been un@@ documented immigrants themselves , and have feared jeopardi@@ zing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child .
the risk increased in june , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints , and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities .
last week , matthew al@@ b@@ ence , a senior official with immigration and customs enforcement , testified before congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor un@@ accompanied minors .
the agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records .
" close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally , and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens .
so we are continuing to pursue those individuals , " mr. al@@ b@@ ence said .
seeking to process the children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained , rather than after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to shelter workers .
many will appear via video conference call , rather than in person , to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge .
those who are deemed in@@ eligible for relief will be swiftly de@@ ported .
the longer that children remain in custody , the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent out@@ bursts or escape attempts , according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months .
advocates said those concerns are heigh@@ tened at a larger facility like tor@@ n@@ illo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked , because of its size .
they added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with .
syria tells us , french and turkish ' occupying forces ' to withdraw immediately
addressing the un general assembly , foreign minister wal@@ id al@@ -@@ mou@@ al@@ em also called on syrian refugees to come home , even though the country 's war is now in its eighth year .
mou@@ al@@ em , who also serves as deputy prime minister , said the foreign forces were on syrian soil illegally , under the pre@@ text of fighting terrorism , and " will be dealt with accordingly . "
" they must withdraw immediately and without any conditions , " he told the assembly .
mou@@ al@@ em insisted that the " war on terror is almost over " in syria , where more than 3@@ 60,000 people have died since 2011 , with millions more upro@@ o@@ ted from their homes .
he said damascus would continue " fighting this sacred battle until we pur@@ ge all syrian territories " of both terror groups and " any illegal foreign presence . "
the united states has some 2,000 troops in syria , mainly training and advis@@ ing both kurdish forces and syrian arabs opposed to president bashar al@@ -@@ assad .
france has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war@@ -@@ wr@@ acked country .
on the issue of refugees , mou@@ al@@ em said the conditions were fine for them to return , and he blamed " some western countries " for " spreading irrational fears " that prompted refugees to stay away .
" we have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns , " he said .
" they are politici@@ zing what should be a purely humanitarian issue . "
the united states and the european union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for syria until there is a political agreement between assad and the opposition to end the war .
un diplomats say a recent agreement between russia and turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel strongh@@ old of id@@ li@@ b has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks .
the russi@@ an@@ -@@ turkish deal aver@@ ted a lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale assault by russi@@ an@@ -@@ backed syrian forces on the province , where three million people live .
mou@@ al@@ em however stressed that the agreement had " clear dead@@ lines " and expressed hope that military action will target ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts including fighters from the al@@ -@@ q@@ ae@@ da@@ -@@ linked n@@ us@@ ra front , who " will be erad@@ icated . "
un envoy sta@@ ff@@ an de mi@@ st@@ ura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee com@@ prised of government and opposition members to draft a post@@ -@@ war constitution for syria and pave the way to elections .
mou@@ al@@ em laid out conditions for the syrian government 's participation in the committee , saying the panel 's work should be restricted " to reviewing the articles of the current constitution , " and warned against interference .
why trump will win a second term
by that logic , mr. trump would win re@@ -@@ election in 2020 unless , as many liberal viewers are probably hoping , impeachment and scandal end his presidency pre@@ mat@@ urely .
in what would no doubt be " the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever ! "
as of now , there are no signs of viewer fatigue .
since 2014 , pri@@ me@@ -@@ time ratings have more than doubled to 1.@@ 05 million at cnn and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at m@@ sn@@ bc .
fox news has an average of 2.4 million pri@@ me@@ -@@ time viewers , up from 1.7 million four years ago , according to ni@@ el@@ sen , and m@@ sn@@ bc 's " the rachel mad@@ dow show " has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights .
" this is a fire that people are being drawn to because it 's not something we understand , " said neal ba@@ er , show runner of the abc drama " designated survivor , " about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol .
nell sco@@ vel@@ l , a veteran comedy writer and author of " just the funny parts : and a few hard truths about sneaking into the hollywood boys " club , " has another theory .
she remembers a cab ride in boston before the 2016 election .
the driver told her he would be voting for mr. trump .
why ? she asked .
" he said , " because he makes me laugh , " " ms. sco@@ vel@@ l told me .

outside money floods into tigh@@ test mid@@ term election house races
it 's not surprising that pennsylvania 's 17@@ th is seeing a flood of cash , thanks to a real@@ ignment of a congressional districts that landed two incum@@ b@@ ents in a race for the same seat .
this recently re@@ drawn suburban pitts@@ burg district pits democrat rep@@ . con@@ or lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring .
lamb is running against another incumbent , republican keith ro@@ th@@ fus , who currently represents the old pennsylvania 12@@ th district , which overlap@@ s heavily with the new 17@@ th .
the maps were re@@ drawn after the pennsylvania supreme court ruled in january that the old districts were un@@ constitu@@ tionally ger@@ ry@@ man@@ dered in republicans ' favor .
the race in the new 17@@ th has touched off a campaign finance slu@@ g@@ f@@ est between the major party finance arms , the democratic campaign congressional committee ( d@@ cc@@ c ) and the national republican campaign committee ( n@@ r@@ cc ) .
lamb became a familiar name in pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in march special election for pennsylvania 's 18@@ th congressional district .
that seat had been held by a republican for over a decade , and president donald trump won the district by 20 points .
political pun@@ d@@ its have given democrats a slight edge .
u.s. weighed pen@@ alizing el salvador over support for china , then backed off
diplomats noted that the domin@@ ican republic and panama had already recognized beijing , with little push@@ back from washington .
mr. trump had a warm meeting with president juan carlos v@@ are@@ la of panama in june 2017 and had a hotel in panama until partners ev@@ ic@@ ted the trump organization 's management team .
state department officials decided to call back the american chiefs of diplomatic missions from el salvador , the domin@@ ican republic and panama over the " recent decisions to no longer recognize taiwan , " heather nau@@ er@@ t , the department 's spokeswoman , said in a statement early this month .
but penalties were only considered against el salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in american aid in 2017 , including for narcotics controls , development and economic support .
the proposed penalties , which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions , would have been painful for the central american country and its high unemployment and murder rates .
as internal meetings progressed , north american and central american officials postponed a high@@ -@@ level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the united states .
but by mid@@ -@@ september , top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward , effectively ending any consideration of penalties for el salvador .
vice president mike pence is now sla@@ ted to address the conference , now scheduled for mid@@ -@@ october , in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering , the diplomats said .
and the three american en@@ voys quietly returned to el salvador , panama and the domin@@ ican republic with no new tough messages or punishments from washington .
a white house spokesman for mr. bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three american officials , including two diplomats , who agreed to discuss the internal deliber@@ ations on the condition of anonym@@ ity .
their accounts were corro@@ bor@@ ated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity .
study history
the next shoe to drop could be the special counsel robert mu@@ eller 's report on mr. trump 's possible obstruction of justice , of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record .
mr. mu@@ eller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether mr. trump 's campaign coll@@ uded with russia in its attack on our elections .
should congress change hands , mr. trump will find himself facing accountability in that body , just as he prepares to go again before the voters , and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers .
that is a lot of if@@ s , and i do not mean to suggest that mr. trump 's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equi@@ val@@ ents in europe .
there are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be .
in 19@@ 38 , german officers were ready to stage a coup d " é@@ tat against hitler , if only the west had resisted him and backed the c@@ ze@@ cho@@ slo@@ va@@ ks at munich .
we failed , and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of car@@ nage that en@@ sued .
the course of history pivo@@ ts around such infl@@ ection points , and democracy 's in@@ exor@@ able march is accelerated or delayed .
americans face several of these infl@@ ection points now .
what will we do if mr. trump fires deputy attorney general rod rosen@@ stein , the man who controls the fate of mr. mu@@ eller 's investigation ?
rosen@@ stein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that , last year , he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being un@@ fit for office .
mr. rosen@@ stein says the times 's account is inaccurate .
" how will we respond if the newly requested f@@ .@@ b@@ .@@ i. investigation of bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the supreme court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony ?
and above all , will we vote in the mid@@ terms for a congress that will hold mr. trump accountable ?
if we fail those tests , democracy will be in for a long winter .
but i believe we will not fail , because of the lesson i learned in prague .
my mother was a c@@ ze@@ cho@@ slov@@ ak jew who was de@@ ported to aus@@ ch@@ witz by the same nazi regime that once occupied my ambassa@@ d@@ orial home .

with that as my heritage , how can i not be an optimis@@ t about our future ? "

rang@@ ers ' graham dor@@ r@@ ans optimistic ahead of rapid vienna clash
rang@@ ers host rapid vienna on thursday , knowing that victory over the austri@@ ans , following the impressive draw in spain against vill@@ ar@@ real earlier this month , will put them in a strong position to qualify from group g of the euro@@ pa league .
a knee injury prevented midfielder graham dor@@ r@@ ans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2@@ -@@ 2 draw with vill@@ ar@@ real but he believes rang@@ ers can use that result as a spring@@ board to greater things .
" it was a good point for us because vill@@ ar@@ real are a good side , " said the 3@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old .
" we went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point .
maybe we could have nic@@ ked it in the end but , overall , a draw was probably a fair result .
they were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side .
going into thursday , it 's another big european night .
hopefully , we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but , with the crowd behind us , i 'm sure we can push on and get a positive result .
last year was definitely tough , between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there 's a feel@@ good factor about the place now .
the squad 's good and the boys are really enjoying it ; the training 's good .
hopefully , we can push on now , put last season behind us and be successful . "
women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear
despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for , few people were talking to their family members about it .
about half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long@@ -@@ term care .
only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it .
" people want a family member to care for them , but they aren 't taking the steps to have the conversation , " said holly sn@@ y@@ der , vice president of nationwide 's life insurance business .
here 's where to begin .
talk to your spouse and the kids : you can 't prepare your family to provide care if you don 't make your wishes known well ahead of time .
work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care , as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost .
bring in your financial advisor : your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses .
your funding choices for long@@ -@@ term care can include a traditional long@@ -@@ term care insurance policy , a hybrid cash@@ -@@ value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self@@ -@@ in@@ suring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money .
hammer out your legal documents : head off legal battles at the pass .
get a health@@ -@@ care proxy in place so that you desig@@ nate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you 're unable to communicate .
also , consider a power of attorney for your finances .
you would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you 're in@@ capac@@ itated .
don 't forget the small details : imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital .
would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies ?
spell out those details in a written plan so that you 're ready .
" it 's not just the financi@@ als that are in play , but who are the doctors ? " asked martin .
" what are the medications ?
who will care for the dog ?
have that plan in place . "

federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for ny@@ c terror attack suspect
federal prosecutors in new york are seeking the death penalty for say@@ ful@@ lo sai@@ po@@ v , the suspect in the new york city terror attack that killed eight people -@@ - a rare punishment that hasn 't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953 .
sai@@ po@@ v , 30 , allegedly used a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the west side highway in lower manhattan , mo@@ wing down pedestrians and cycl@@ ist in his path on oct .
in order to justify a death sentence , prosecutors will have to prove that sai@@ po@@ v " intentionally " killed the eight victims and " intentionally " inflic@@ ted serious bodily injury , according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty , filed in the southern district of new york .
both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence , according to the court document .
weeks after the attack , a federal grand jury slapped sai@@ po@@ v with a 22@@ -@@ count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of rac@@ ke@@ te@@ ering , typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases , and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles .
the attack required " substantial planning and pre@@ meditation , " prosecutors said , describing the manner in which sai@@ po@@ v carried it out as " he@@ inous , cruel and dep@@ ra@@ ved . "
" say@@ ful@@ lo ha@@ bi@@ bul@@ la@@ evi@@ c sai@@ po@@ v caused injury , harm , and loss to the families and friends of diego enri@@ que angel@@ ini , nicholas cle@@ ves , ann@@ -@@ la@@ ure decad@@ t , dar@@ ren drake , ari@@ el er@@ li@@ j , her@@ nan fer@@ ru@@ chi , her@@ nan diego men@@ do@@ za , and ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro dam@@ ian pag@@ n@@ uc@@ co , " the notice of intent states .
five of the victims were tourists from argentina .
it has been a decade since the southern district of new york last prosecuted a death penalty case .
the defendant , khal@@ id barnes , was convicted of mur@@ dering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in september 2009 .
the last time the death penalty was carried out in a new york federal case was in 1953 for juli@@ us and ethe@@ l rosen@@ berg , a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the soviet union during the cold war two years before .
both rosen@@ ber@@ gs were both put to death by the electric chair on june 19 , 1953 .
sai@@ po@@ v , a native of uzbekistan , demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack , according to court documents .
he stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done , police said .
sai@@ po@@ v told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching isis videos on his phone , according to the indictment .
he also requested to display the isis flag in his hospital room , police said .
he has pleaded not guilty to the 22@@ -@@ count indictment .
david pat@@ ton , one of the federal public defenders representing sai@@ po@@ v , said they are " obviously disappointed " with the prosecution 's decision .
" we think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved , " pat@@ ton said .
sai@@ po@@ v 's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty .
tory mp says nigel far@@ age should be put in charge of brexit negotiations
nigel far@@ age vowed to ' mobil@@ ise the people 's army ' today during a protest at the tory conference .
the former u@@ ki@@ p leader said politicians had to ' feel the heat ' from euro@@ scep@@ tics - as one of the@@ resa may 's own mps suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the eu .
conservative back@@ ben@@ cher peter bone told the march in birmingham that the uk ' would have been out ' by now if mr far@@ age was brexit secretary .
but the challenge mrs may faces in reconc@@ iling her deeply divided ranks has been under@@ lined by pro@@ -@@ remain tories joining a separate protest against brexit in the city .
the premier is struggling to keep her che@@ qu@@ ers compromise plan on track amid attacks from bre@@ xi@@ te@@ ers , remain@@ ers and the eu .
allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with brussels despite the back@@ lash - and force euro@@ scep@@ tics and labour to choose between her package and ' chaos ' .
mr bone told the leave means leave rally in sol@@ i@@ hull that he wanted to ' chuck che@@ qu@@ ers ' .
he suggested mr far@@ age should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with brussels .
'@@ if he had been in charge , we would have been out by now , ' he said .
the well@@ ing@@ borough mp added : ' i will stand up for brexit but we need to chuck che@@ qu@@ ers . ' 
setting out his opposition to the eu , he said : ' we didn 't fight world wars to be sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent .
we want to make our own laws in our own country . '
mr bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote : ' the idea that the british people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely un@@ true . ' 
tory bre@@ xi@@ te@@ er andrea jen@@ ky@@ ns was also at the march , telling reporters : ' i am simply saying : prime minister , listen to the people .
'@@ che@@ qu@@ ers is unpopular with the general public , the opposition 's not going to vote for it , it 's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place .
please drop che@@ qu@@ ers and start listening . '
in a pointed message to mrs may , she added : ' prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises . ' 
mr far@@ age told the rally politicians must be made to ' feel the heat ' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum .
'@@ this is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class , ' he said .
'@@ they are trying to betray brexit and we are here today to tell them ' we won 't let you get away with doing that ' . '
in a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added : ' i want you to make our political class , who are on the verge of betra@@ ying brexit , feel the heat .
'@@ we are mobil@@ ising the people 's army of this country that gave us victory in brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent , self@@ -@@ governing , proud united kingdom . '
meanwhile , remain@@ ers marched through birmingham before holding a two@@ -@@ hour rally in the city centre .
a s@@ mat@@ tering of activists waved tories against brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend .
labour peer lord ad@@ on@@ is moc@@ ked the conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened .
'@@ these are the people who tell us they can have the it systems in place and all of the technology for canada plus plus , for the fric@@ tionless border , for free trade without borders in ireland , ' he added .
'@@ it is a complete farce .
there isn 't such a thing as a good brexit , ' he added .

russian grand prix : lewis hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over sebastian ve@@ t@@ tel
it became clear from the moment that val@@ t@@ ter@@ i bott@@ as qualified ahead of lewis hamilton on saturday that mercedes " team orders would play a large part in the race .
from pole , bott@@ as got a good start and almost hung hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited ve@@ t@@ tel to attack his team@@ mate .
ve@@ t@@ tel went into the pits first and left hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack , something which should have been decisive .
the mercedes pit@@ ted a lap later and came out behind ve@@ t@@ tel , but hamilton went ahead after some wheel@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ wheel action that saw the ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a doub@@ le@@ -@@ move to defend on the third corner .
max ver@@ st@@ ap@@ pen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 2@@ 1@@ st birthday .
he then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his ty@@ res to target a quick finish and overtake kim@@ i ra@@ ik@@ kon@@ en for fourth .
he eventually came into the pits on the 4@@ 4@@ th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight lap@@ s as ra@@ ik@@ kon@@ en took fourth .
it 's a difficult day because val@@ t@@ ter@@ i did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by .
the team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two , " said hamilton .
that was really bad body language
president donald trump moc@@ ked senator di@@ anne fe@@ instein at a rally on saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from christine blas@@ ey ford accusing supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh of sexual assault .
speaking at a rally in west virginia , the president did not directly address the testimony given by ford before the senate judiciary committee , instead comm@@ enting that what was going on in the senate showed that people were " mean and nasty and un@@ tru@@ thful . "
" the one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the senate , when you see the anger , when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and un@@ tru@@ thful , " he said .
" when you look at releases and leaks and then they say " oh , i didn 't do it .
i didn 't do it . "
remember ?
di@@ anne fe@@ instein , did you leak ?
remember her answer ... did you leak the document - " oh , oh , what ?
oh , no .
i didn 't leak . "
well , wait one minute .
did we leak ... no , we didn 't leak , " he added , in an impression of the senator .
fe@@ instein was sent the letter deta@@ iling the allegations against k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh by ford back in july , and it was leaked earlier in september - but fe@@ instein denied that the leak came from her office .
" i did not hide dr. ford 's allegations , i did not leak her story , " fe@@ instein told the committee , the hill reported .
" she asked me to hold it confidential and i kept it confidential as she asked . "
but her denial did not appear to sit well with the president , who commented during the saturday night rally : " i 'll tell you what , that was really bad body language .
maybe she didn 't , but that 's the worst body language i 've ever seen . "
continuing his defense of the supreme court nominee , who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women , the president suggested that the democrats were using the allegations for their own ends .
" they are determined to take back power by any means necessary .
you see the mean@@ ness , the na@@ st@@ iness , they don 't care who they hurt , who they have to run over to get power and control , " medi@@ a@@ ite reported the president saying .

air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
an air traffic controller in indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground .
more than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of su@@ law@@ esi on friday , triggering a tsunami .
strong after@@ shocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of pal@@ u .
but despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives , 2@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old anth@@ on@@ ius gun@@ a@@ wan ag@@ ung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at mu@@ ti@@ ara sis al ju@@ fr@@ i airport pal@@ u airport .
he stayed put to make sure that the ba@@ ti@@ k air flight 6@@ 3@@ 21 , which was on the runway at the time , was able to take off safely .
he then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collap@@ sing .
he died later in hospital .
spokesman for air navigation indonesia , yo@@ h@@ ann@@ es si@@ ra@@ it , said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives , australia 's abc news reported .
we prepared a helicopter from b@@ ali@@ k@@ pap@@ an in kal@@ im@@ antan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city .
unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached pal@@ u .
" our heart breaks to hear about this , " he added .
meanwhile , authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country 's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of dong@@ gala , sig@@ i and b@@ out@@ ong is limited .
" the toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached , " agency spokesman su@@ top@@ o pur@@ wo nu@@ gro@@ ho said .
waves that reached up to six meters have devastated pal@@ u which will hold a mass burial on sunday .
military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies .
ris@@ a k@@ us@@ uma , a 35@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old mother , told sky news : " every minute an ambulance brings in bodies .
clean water is scarce .
the mini@@ -@@ markets are loo@@ ted everywhere . "
jan gel@@ f@@ and , head of the international red cross in indonesia , told cnn : " the indonesian red cross is racing to help survivors but we don 't know what they 'll find there .
this is already a tragedy , but it could get much worse . "
indonesia 's president jo@@ ko wido@@ do arrived in pal@@ u on sunday and told the country 's military : " i am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation .
are you ready ? " cnn reported .
indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in lom@@ bo@@ k in which more than 550 people died .
micron@@ es@@ ia plane crash : air ni@@ ug@@ ini now says one man missing after lag@@ oon plane crash
the airline operating a flight that crashed into a pacific lag@@ oon in micron@@ es@@ ia now says one man is missing , after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane .
air ni@@ ug@@ ini said in a release that as of saturday afternoon , it was unable to account for a male passenger .
the airline said it was working with local authorities , hospitals and investigators to try to find the man .
the airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger , such as his age or nationality .
local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the chu@@ uk island airport .
officials said on friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital .
the airline said six passengers remained at the hospital saturday , and all of them were in stable condition .
what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear .
the airline and the u.s. navy both said the plane landed in the lag@@ oon short of the runway .
some witnesses thought the plane over@@ shot the runway .
american passenger bill ja@@ yn@@ es said the plane came in very low .
" that 's an extremely good thing , " said ja@@ yn@@ es .
ja@@ yn@@ es said he and others managed to wade through waist@@ -@@ deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane .
he said the flight attendants were pan@@ icking and yelling , and that he suffered a minor head injury .
the u.s. navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters ( 100 feet ) of water .
data from the aviation safety network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of p@@ ng@@ -@@ registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved air ni@@ ug@@ ini .
analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive
the prosecution rested its case saturday in the re@@ trial of a man who is accused of burning a mississippi woman alive in 2014 .
u.s. department of justice analyst paul row@@ lett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis .
he outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old defendant quin@@ ton tell@@ is and the 19@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old victim , jessica chambers , on the night she died .
row@@ lett said he received location data from several cell@@ phones that showed tell@@ is was with chambers the evening of her death , contradic@@ ting his previous claims , the clar@@ ion ledger reported .
when data showed his cellphone was with chambers ' during the time he said he was with his friend michael san@@ ford , police went to talk to san@@ ford .
san@@ ford took the stand saturday and testified that he wasn 't in town that day .
when prosecutors asked if tell@@ is was telling the truth when he said he was in san@@ ford 's truck that night , san@@ ford said he was " lying , because my truck was in n@@ ash@@ ville . "
another in@@ consistency was that tell@@ is said he had known chambers for about two weeks when she died .
cellphone records indicated they 'd only known each other for a week .
row@@ lett said that sometime after chambers ' death , tell@@ is deleted chambers ' texts , calls and contact information from his phone .
" he erased her from his life , " hale said .
the defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments sunday .
the judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day .

ny nanny sues couple over firing after " racist " text
a new york nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a mis@@ directed text from the mother complaining that she was " another black person . "
the couple deny they are racist , lik@@ ening the suit to " extortion . "
lyn@@ sey plas@@ co@@ -@@ fla@@ x@@ man , a mother of two , expressed dis@@ may when finding out that the new child care provider , g@@ is@@ elle maur@@ ice , was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016 .
" no@@ oo@@ oo@@ oo@@ oo@@ oo another black person , " wrote mrs plas@@ co@@ -@@ fla@@ x@@ man to her husband in a text .
however , instead of sending it to her husband , she sent it to ms. maur@@ ice , twice .
after realizing her ga@@ ffe , an " uncomfortable " plas@@ co@@ -@@ fla@@ x@@ man fired ms. maur@@ ice , stating that their outgoing nanny , who was afric@@ an@@ -@@ american , had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a filipino , according to the new york post .
ms. maur@@ ice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an uber .
now , maur@@ ice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing , and is seeking compensation to the tune of $ 350 a day for the six@@ -@@ month , live@@ -@@ in gig she had initially been hired to do , albeit without a contract .
" i want to show them , look , you don 't do stuff like that , " she told the post on friday , adding " i know it 's discrimination . "
the couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist , saying that termin@@ ating maur@@ ice 's employment was the reasonable thing to do , fearing they could not trust her after off@@ ending her .
" my wife had sent her something that she didn 't mean to say .
she 's not a racist .
we 're not racist people , " husband joel plas@@ co told the post .
" but would you put your children in the hands of someone you 've been rude to , even if it was by mistake ?
your newborn baby ?
come on . "
lik@@ ening the suit to " extortion , " plas@@ co said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a " very difficult situation . "
" you 're going to go after someone like that ?
that 's not a very nice thing to do , " the investment banker added .
while the legal case is still ongoing , the court of public opinion has been quick to den@@ ounce the couple on social media , slam@@ ming them for their behavior and logic .
pad@@ ding@@ ton publishers feared readers wouldn 't relate to a talking bear , new letter reveals
bond 's daughter karen jan@@ kel , who was born shortly after the book was accepted , said of the letter : " it 's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published .
it 's very amusing knowing now what we know about pad@@ ding@@ ton 's huge success . "
saying her father , who had worked as a bbc camer@@ aman before being inspired to write the children 's book by a small toy bear , would have been s@@ angu@@ ine about his work being rejected , she added the 60@@ th anniversary of the books publication was " bitter@@ sweet " after his death last year .
of pad@@ ding@@ ton , whom she describes as a " very important member of our family , " she added her father was quietly proud of his event@@ ual success .
" he was quite a quiet man , and he wasn 't a bo@@ ast@@ ful person , " she said .
" but because pad@@ ding@@ ton was so real to him , it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something : you 're proud of them even though it 's not your doing really .
i think he viewed pad@@ ding@@ ton 's success sort of in that way .
although it was his creation and his imagination , he always used to give the credit to pad@@ ding@@ ton himself . "
my daughter was dying and i had to say goodbye over the phone
on landing her daughter had been rushed to nice 's hospital louis pas@@ teur 2 , where doctors worked in vain to save her life .
" n@@ ad was calling regularly to say it was really bad , that she wasn 't expected to make it , " said mrs ed@@ nan@@ -@@ lap@@ er@@ ouse .
" then i got the call from n@@ ad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and i had to say goodbye to her .
and i did .
i said , " t@@ ashi , i love you so much , darling .
i 'll be with you soon .
i 'll be with you .
the drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly pe@@ tering out and leaving her system .
she had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down .
i had to just sit there and wait , knowing this was all un@@ folding .
i couldn 't how@@ l or scream or cry because i was in a situation surrounded by families and people .
i had to really hold it together . "
eventually mrs ed@@ nan@@ -@@ lap@@ er@@ ouse , by now griev@@ ing for the loss of her daughter , boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - obli@@ vious to the or@@ deal she was going through .
" no@@ -@@ one knew , " she said .
" i had my head down , and tears were falling the whole time .
it 's hard to explain , but it was on the flight i felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for n@@ ad .
that he needed my love and understanding .
i knew how much he loved her . "
griev@@ ing women post cards to prevent su@@ icides on bridge
two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives .
sharon davis and kelly humph@@ re@@ ys have been posting cards on a wel@@ sh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support .
ms davis ' son tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18 .
" i don 't want any parent to feel the way i have to feel everyday , " she said .
ms davis , aged 45 , who lives in ly@@ dney , said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin .
" everyone knew him for his smile .
they always said his smile lit up any room . "
however , he gave up work before he died , as he was " in a really dark place . "
in 2014 , tyler 's brother , who was 11 at the time , was the one to find his si@@ bling after he had taken his own life .
ms davis said : " i continually worry that there 's going to be a knock on effect . "
ms davis created the cards , " to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to , even if it 's a friend .
don 't sit in silence - you need to talk . "
ms humph@@ re@@ ys , who has been friends with ms davi@@ es for years , lost mark , her partner of 15 years , not long after the death of his mother .
" he didn 't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything , " she said .
" a couple of days before christmas we noticed his change in attitude .
he was at rock bottom on christmas day - when the kids opened their presents he didn 't make eye contact with them or anything . "
she said his death was a huge trauma to them , but they have to work through it : " it ri@@ ps a hole through the family .
it tears us apart .

bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's future hangs in the balance as fbi begins investigation
" i thought , if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time , limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity , " said mr flake on saturday , adding that he feared the committee was " falling apart " amid ent@@ renched partisan grid@@ lock .
why didn 't mr k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh and his republican supporters want the fbi to investigate ?
their reluctance is all due to timing .
the mid@@ term elections are only five weeks away , on november 6 - if , as expected , the republicans do badly , then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land .
george w@@ . bush has been picking up the phone to call senators , lobbying them to support mr k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh , who worked in the white house for mr bush and through him met his wife ashley , who was mr bush 's personal secretary .
what happens after the fbi produces its report ?
there will be a vote in the senate , where 51 republicans and 49 democrats currently sit .
it 's still not clear whether mr k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh can get to at least 50 votes on the senate floor , which would allow mike pence , the vice president , to break a tie and confirm him to the supreme court .
north korea defec@@ tor numbers ' drop ' under kim
the number of north korean defec@@ tors to south korea has fallen since kim j@@ ong@@ -@@ un came to power seven years ago , a south korean law@@ maker has said .
park b@@ yeong@@ -@@ se@@ u@@ g , citing data from the south 's unification ministry , said there had been 1,@@ 127 defec@@ tions last year - compared with 2,@@ 7@@ 06 in 2011 .
mr park said tighter border controls between north korea and china and higher rates charged by people smugg@@ lers were key factors .
pyongyang has made no public comments .
the vast majority of defec@@ tors from the north are eventually offered south korean citizenship .
seoul says more than 30,000 north koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the korean war in 1953 .
most flee via china , which has the longest border with north korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected de@@ milit@@ ar@@ ised zone ( d@@ m@@ z ) between the two kore@@ as .
china regards the defec@@ tors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatri@@ ates them .
relations between the north and the south - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months .
earlier this month , the leaders of the two countries met in pyongyang for talks that cent@@ red on the stalled denuclear@@ isation negotiations .
this came after june 's historic meeting between us president donald trump and kim j@@ ong@@ -@@ un in singapore , when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the n@@ uclear@@ -@@ free korean peninsula .
but on saturday , north korean foreign minister ri yong@@ -@@ ho blamed us sanctions for the lack of progress since then .
" without any trust in the us , there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances , there is no way we will unilaterally dis@@ arm ourselves first , " mr ri said in a speech to the un general assembly in new york .
nancy pel@@ osi calls bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh " hyster@@ ical , " says he is un@@ fit to serve on the supreme court
house minority leader nancy pel@@ osi called supreme court nominee bre@@ tt k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh " hyster@@ ical " and said that he was temper@@ am@@ entally un@@ fit to serve on the supreme court .
pel@@ osi made the comments in an interview saturday at the texas tribun@@ e festival in austin , texas .
" i couldn 't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way , they would say ' hyster@@ ical , ' " pel@@ osi said about her reaction to k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's testimony before the senate judiciary committee on thursday .
k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted dr. christine blas@@ ey ford when they were both teenagers .
during his opening statement , k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh was very emotional , at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years .
he also explicitly condemned democrats on the committee , calling the allegations against him a " gro@@ tes@@ que and coordinated character assassination " organized by liber@@ als angry that hillary clinton lost the 2016 presidential election .
pel@@ osi said that she believed k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh 's testimony proved that he could not serve on the supreme court , because it showed that he is biased against democrats .
" i think that he dis@@ quali@@ fies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the clin@@ tons and the democrats , " she said .
pel@@ osi dem@@ urred when asked if she would try to impe@@ ach k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh if he is confirmed , and if democrats gain the majority in the house of representatives .
" i will say this -@@ - if he is not telling the truth to congress or to the fbi , then he 's not fit not only to be on the supreme court , but to be on the court he 's on right now , " pel@@ osi said .
k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh is currently a judge on the d.@@ c@@ . circuit court of appeals .
pel@@ osi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh rul@@ ings against the affordable care act or roe v@@ . wade , as he is considered to be a conservative justice .
in his confirmation hearings , k@@ av@@ an@@ au@@ gh si@@ des@@ te@@ pped questions on whether he would over@@ turn certain supreme court decisions .
" it 's not time for a hyster@@ ical , biased person to go to the court and expect us to say , ' isn 't that wonderful , ' " pel@@ osi said .
and women need to wi@@ eld it .
it is a righteous di@@ atri@@ be , months and years of fury sp@@ illing over , and she can 't get it out without weeping .
" we cry when we get angry , " ms. ste@@ ine@@ m said to me 45 years later .
" i don 't think that 's uncommon , do you ? "
she continued , " i was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace , who said she also cried when she got angry , but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry , she 'd say to the person she was talking to , " you may think i am sad because i am crying .
i am angry . "
and then she just kept going .
and i thought that was brilliant . "
tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood .
one of my shar@@ pest memories from an early job , in a male@@ -@@ dominated office , where i once found myself weeping with in@@ expres@@ sible rage , was my being grabbed by the scru@@ ff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom i 'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stair@@ well .
" never let them see you crying , " she told me .
" they don 't know you 're furious .
they think you 're sad and will be pleased because they got to you . "
pat@@ r@@ icia sch@@ roe@@ der , then a democratic congres@@ s@@ woman from colorado , had worked with gary hart on his presidential runs .
in 1987 , when mr. hart was caught in an extra@@ marital affair aboard a boat called monkey business and bowed out of the race , ms. sch@@ roe@@ der , deeply frustrated , figured there was no reason she shouldn 't explore the idea of running for president herself .
" it was not a well@@ -@@ thought@@ -@@ out decision , " she said to me with a laugh 30 years later .
" there were already seven other candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another one .
somebody called it " snow white and the seven dwar@@ fs . " "
because it was late in the campaign , she was behind on fun@@ d@@ -@@ raising , and so she vowed that she wouldn 't enter the race unless she raised $ 2 million .
it was a losing battle .
she discovered that some of her supporters who gave $ 1,000 to men would give her only $ 250 .
" do they think i get a discount ? " she wondered .
when she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who 'd supported her , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates , and anger at the sex@@ ism - that she got choked up .
" you would have thought i 'd had a nervous breakdown , " recalled ms. sch@@ roe@@ der about how the press reacted to her .
" you 'd have thought kle@@ ene@@ x was my corporate sponsor .
i remember thinking , what are they going to put on my tombstone ?
" she cried " ? " "
how the us@@ -@@ china trade war may be good for beijing
the opening sal@@ vos of the trade war between the us and china were deaf@@ ening , and while the battle is far from over , a rift between the countries may be beneficial to beijing in the long term , experts say .
donald trump , the us president , fired the first warning earlier this year by ta@@ xing key chinese exports including solar panels , steel and aluminium .
the most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $ 200 billion ( £ 150 billion ) worth of items , effectively ta@@ xing half of all goods coming into the us from china .
beijing has retali@@ ated each time in kind , most recently sl@@ apping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $ 60 billion of american goods .
china has pledged to match the us shot@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ shot , and the world 's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon .
getting washington to back down means caving into demands , but publicly bo@@ wing to the us would be far too embarrassing for xi jinping , china 's president .
still , experts say if beijing can play its cards right , us trade war pressures could positively support china over the long term by lowering the inter@@ -@@ dependence of the two economies .
" the fact that a quick political decision in either washington or beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tail@@ spin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before , " said abig@@ ail grace , a research associate who focuses on asia at the center for new american security , a think tank .
syria ' ready ' for refugees to return , says foreign minister
syria says it 's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven@@ -@@ year long war .
speaking to the united nations general assembly , foreign minister wal@@ id al@@ -@@ mou@@ al@@ em said conditions in the country are improving .
" today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism , " he said .
the government continues to rehabil@@ itate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal@@ cy .
all conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their liveli@@ hoods .
the un estimates that more than 5.5 million syri@@ ans have fled the country since the war began in 2011 .
another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance .
al@@ -@@ mou@@ al@@ em said the syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country .
but he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insur@@ gency .

michael jackson wore tape on his nose to get front pages , former bodyguard claims
michael jackson 's former bodyguard has claimed the late singer cultivated some of his ec@@ centr@@ ici@@ ties with the deliberate intention of r@@ iling up the media .
matt fi@@ d@@ des , now a property developer and owner of a martial arts / dance chain , told metro that jackson believed the fasc@@ ination around his person@@ a would stop if he ceased to be a " mystery " in the public eye .
to get front pages , he would reportedly don surgical masks and put tape on his nose to spark conversation .
we 'll tell you what 's true . you can form your own view .
" he knew how to manipulate the media . he knew exactly how to get the front page , " fi@@ d@@ des , who was jackson 's bodyguard for 10 years , said . " 90 per cent of the time it worked , by putting a mask on his face , or sticky tape on his hands - or tape on his nose was a favourite one . he would say he wanted his life to be the greatest mystery on earth . "
he added : " it 's back@@ fired on him now , though , that 's the sad thing . "
fi@@ d@@ des also addressed allegations of child sexual abuse against jackson by wade rob@@ son and james safe@@ chuck , which were ai@@ red in the controversial , em@@ my a@@ ward@@ -@@ winning documentary leaving never@@ land .
both rob@@ son and safe@@ chuck alle@@ ge that they were abused by jackson as children for a number of years .
fi@@ d@@ des claimed that " this whole pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile thing is complete nonsense ... the guy had girlfriends and had a legitimate marriage to lisa marie [ pres@@ ley ] , that was the way he lived his life . "
he claimed it would have been " impossible " for jackson to have abused children at his never@@ land ranch because he was " hardly " there .
" they say there were boys around , that was not the case at all , " he said .
the jackson estate has denied all allegations against the late star . jackson denied all claims against him until his death in 2009 .

new delhi :
the government has compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 more tax officers in the fourth tran@@ che of its crackdown on err@@ ant officials accused of corruption and other mal@@ practices .
the central board of indirect taxes and customs ( c@@ bic ) -@@ - the agency that over@@ sees g@@ st and import tax collections -@@ - compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 senior officers under fundamental rule 56 ( j ) on corruption and other charges , official sources said .
since june , this is the fourth round of sac@@ king of corrupt tax officials . in the previous three rounds , 49 high ranking tax officers , including 12 from the central board of direct taxes ( c@@ b@@ dt ) , were compul@@ sor@@ ily retired .
sources said the action was in line with prime minister na@@ ren@@ dra modi 's address to the nation from the ram@@ parts of the red fort when he had said some black sheep in the tax administration may have mis@@ used their powers and harassed taxpayers , either by targeting honest ass@@ esses or taking excessive action for minor or procedural violations .
" we have recently taken the bold step of compul@@ sor@@ ily retiring a significant number of tax officials , and we will not tolerate this type of behaviour , " he had said .
nearly half of the officials retired were those who were arrested by the c@@ bi for allegedly receiving illegal gra@@ tification . one of them was caught accepting a bribe of rs 15,000 . one official is accused of having assets dis@@ propor@@ tionate to his known source of income .
in june , the government had compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 15 commis@@ sion@@ er@@ -@@ level officials of c@@ bic on charges of corruption , collecting and giving bribes , smuggling and even criminal conspiracy . prior to that , the government had compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 12 senior irs officials from the income tax department over charges of corruption , sexual harassment , dis@@ propor@@ tionate assets under rule 56 ( j ) of the central civil services ( pension ) rules .
in august , the government compul@@ sor@@ ily retired 22 c@@ bic officials . the rule 56 ( j ) of central civil services ( pension ) rules , 1972 provides for periodical review of the performance of government servants with a view to as@@ certain whether they should be retained in service or retired in public interest .
as per these instructions , the cases of government servants covered by fr 56 ( j ) , 56 ( 1 ) or rule 48 ( 1 ) ( b ) of cc@@ s ( pension ) rules , 1972 should be reviewed six months before they attain the age of 50@@ -@@ 55 years , in cases covered by fr 56 ( j ) and on completion of 30 years of qualifying service under fr 56 ( 1 ) or rule 48 of cc@@ s ( pension ) rules , 1972 .
a woman in maine got 500 letters from united healthcare within five days
stephanie lay said she found the piles of letters from the insurance company st@@ ashed in her mailbox between thursday and monday .
" a week ago thursday was the first wave of letters , i got 46 letters , " she told cnn . " i immediately called united healthcare insurance and told them i received 46 letters of the same letter . "
and the letters just kept coming , piling up to more than 500 by monday .
they were addressed to her son , who has autism and lives in a private care facility , she said . but instead of her son 's name inside when you opened them , the letters said dear maine 's department of health and human services -@@ - in cin@@ cin@@ nat@@ i , she told local media .
the letters were about a $ 54 or $ 0 healthcare claim that united healthcare said is not covered , lay said .
when she asked united healthcare why she was receiving a mountain of letters , she was told it was a coding issue , she said .
in a statement , united healthcare told cnn it 's working to resolve the issue but it cannot provide details due to privacy requirements .
" we have determined the cause of the problem . we are very sorry this occurred , and we have contacted the family to discuss the situation with them , " the health insurer said .
lay said the letters all have a message at the bottom urging people to go paper@@ less . " i 'm thinking they had to take down half of a forest just to send this , " she said .

hsbc f@@ lips cri@@ me@@ -@@ spo@@ tting tool to scope new business
british bank hsbc ( hs@@ ba@@ .@@ l ) has converted a financial cri@@ me@@ -@@ spo@@ tting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money@@ -@@ laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities , bank executives said .
the system combines data on clients " banking activities , with public data on company ownership and director@@ ships , to flag desirable potential clients to hsbc staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships .
using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of hsbc 's broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data , a key priority for interim chief executive no@@ el quinn .
" it 's one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention , and the business we 're getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win , " said stuart ni@@ vis@@ on , hsbc 's global head of client network banking .
hsbc declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader " network income " initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue .
the drive is an important part of the bank 's efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the united states where it makes returns below its cost of capital .
hsbc was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $ 1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with u.s. authorities over the bank 's failure to prevent money laundering by drug car@@ te@@ ls though its mexican unit .
the system works by mapping individual customers " and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or un@@ ear@@ thing previously unknown connections between those entities .
that system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to cli@@ ent@@ -@@ facing roles where they can spend time helping customers , said adrian rig@@ by , chief operating officer of hsbc 's trade business .
hsbc 's ni@@ vis@@ on said the light@@ bulb moment was realizing the tool could be re@@ pur@@ posed to look for " green flags " of attractive potential clients rather than " red flags " of wrong@@ doing .
" we took our customer datas@@ et and combined it with ( britain 's ) companies house data and turned the algorithm around to look for attractiveness in a client , whether that be through sector , growth of the company , and connection to existing clients , " ni@@ vis@@ on said .
the tool has mapped 2@@ 2.5 million entities and people in britain , and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually , he said .
iran was promised that ' all ' us sanctions would be lifted in return for talks , rou@@ hani claims
european nations were so eager to negotiate with iran that they suggested the us would end its sanctions regime if tehran was willing to engage in dialogue , president hassan rou@@ hani has said .
according to rou@@ hani , european signat@@ ories of the 2015 nuclear deal urged him to meet with us president donald trump , promising that washington would lift " all " sanctions in return .
" three out of the six countries , that is the chancellor of germany , prime minister of britain , and president of france , all insisted for the meeting to be held , saying that the us would lift all sanctions , " stated the iranian president .
he said he rejected the proposal because , " under sanctions and maximum pressure , " it would have been impossible to predict the end result of any negotiations .
trump quickly denied that he had offered iran any relief , twee@@ ting that tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a prerequisite to talks , but that he had " of course " refused .
in his statement , rou@@ hani also said that numerous countries were on iran 's side during their one@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ one talks on the sidelines of the un@@ ga . " we discussed various issues with various countries , and all of them condemned the united states " withdrawal from the j@@ c@@ po@@ a and its pressures . this is a huge success for iran . "
dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation
dog control laws in scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ control animals and irresponsible owners .
a consultation has been launched by the scottish government seeking the public 's views .
scotland 's community safety minister pledged to " keep communities safe from irresponsible owners , " with reviews to determine whether laws for out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ control dogs need changing .
ash den@@ ham ms@@ p said : " we are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ control dogs .
" this consultation seeks views on improvements on how the control of dogs act 2010 can operate across scotland , and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed .
" owning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities , including keeping your dog under effective control , and i encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation . "
the consultation runs until january 15 and contains proposals to tough@@ en and clarify the current legislation , including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created .
the scottish parliament 's post@@ -@@ legislative scrutiny committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs , prompting the government to review dog control laws .
m@@ sp@@ s were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children .
the committee heard that , in greater glas@@ gow and cly@@ de alone , there were 1,@@ 4@@ 17 people arriving at a & e departments with dog@@ -@@ related injuries , 2@@ 55 of them children , last year .
n@@ hs lan@@ ar@@ kshire treated 9@@ 12 people and n@@ hs ay@@ r@@ shire 4@@ 39 , both four@@ -@@ year highs .
in july , the committee 's m@@ sp@@ s concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the scottish government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog@@ -@@ control laws .
conven@@ er jenny mar@@ ra said : " dog law in scotland is not fit for purpose . there are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks .
" it has become clear that current dog control law doesn 't work . it needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs . "
the consultation , launched on the government 's website on friday , says : " effective and consistent enforcement across scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ control dogs .
" this review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities , as they use their powers to help keep communities safe . "
saudi arabia to offer tourist visas for first time , abolish ab@@ aya rule
visas in saudi are currently restricted to exp@@ at workers , their depen@@ dents and muslim pilgrims .
saudi arabia said friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time , opening up the ultra@@ -@@ conservative kingdom to holid@@ ay@@ makers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil .
kick@@ starting tourism is one of the cent@@ re@@ pieces of crown prince mohammed bin sal@@ man 's vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest arab economy for a post@@ -@@ oil era .
the announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on saudi arabia 's oil infrastructure -@@ - blamed by washington on iran -@@ - which ro@@ iled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict .
" opening saudi arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country , " tourism chief ahmed al@@ -@@ kha@@ te@@ eb said in a statement .
" visitors will be surprised ... by the treasures we have to share -@@ - five unesco world heritage sites , a vibrant local culture and breath@@ taking natural beauty . "
saudi arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on saturday , bloomberg news quoted kha@@ te@@ eb as saying .
kha@@ te@@ eb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women , allowing them to go without the body@@ -@@ shrou@@ ding ab@@ aya robe that is still mandatory public wear for saudi women .
foreign women , however , will be required to wear " modest clothing , " he added , without elabor@@ ating .
visas in the desert kingdom , endo@@ wed with rich be@@ dou@@ in heritage and archaeological sites , are currently restricted to exp@@ at workers , their depen@@ dents and muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in mec@@ ca and me@@ dina .
in a rare move , saudi arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kick@@ start tourism .
but the au@@ st@@ ere kingdom , which for@@ bids alcohol and has a strict social code , is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists .
prince mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liber@@ alisation drive that has brought new cinemas , mix@@ ed@@ -@@ gender concerts and sporting extravag@@ an@@ z@@ as to saudi arabia .
international criticism of the kingdom 's human rights record , including the gru@@ esome murder last year of critic jam@@ al k@@ has@@ ho@@ gg@@ i and a crackdown on female activists , could further put off foreign visitors , observers say .
fears of a regional conflict after the september 14 attacks on state oil giant ar@@ am@@ co may also dam@@ pen the kingdom 's appeal to holid@@ ay@@ makers .
the government , re@@ eling from low oil prices , says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030 , compared to three percent currently .
it says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists .
but the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accom@@ o@@ date visitors in such high numbers , with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade .
the sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs , the government says , as it battles high youth unemployment .
saudi arabia has spl@@ urged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch .
in 2017 , the kingdom announced a multi@@ -@@ billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pri@@ stine sites on the red sea into luxury resorts .
last year , construction of q@@ id@@ di@@ ya " entertainment city " was launched near ri@@ yad@@ h , which would include high@@ -@@ end theme parks , motor sport facilities and a sa@@ far@@ i area .
the country is also developing historic sites such as the cent@@ ur@@ ies@@ -@@ old ma@@ da '@@ in sal@@ eh , home to sandstone tombs of the same civil@@ isation which built the jor@@ dan@@ ian city of pe@@ tra .
facebook hides ' likes ' in new australia trial
facebook has begun hiding the number of " likes " for posts in australia , it said today , a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide .
account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people 's posts from today , but will still be able to see how people respond to their own .
" we don 't want facebook to feel like a competition , " the company said in a statement .
" this is a test to see how people engage with this new format . we hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly , " it said .
more than one billion people use facebook worldwide , but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform 's impact on mental health .
in australia , one in five children report experiencing cyber@@ bullying , according to the country 's es@@ a@@ fe@@ ty commissioner .
facebook 's decision comes after it launched a trial in july to hide " likes " on the company 's other major social media platform , instagram .
what began as a test on instagram in canada was expanded to australia , brazil and several other major markets .
the facebook trial was described as " a limited test in order for us to get some early lear@@ nings . "
" while this has been testing on instagram , facebook and ( instagram ) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test , " the company said .
the social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for .
" we want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience , while also not limiting any positive interactions , " said mia gar@@ lick , of facebook australia .
loren@@ zo strengthens into category 4 hurricane east of caribbean
hurricane loren@@ zo strengthened into a category 4 storm thursday , producing sw@@ ells that could affect parts of the wind@@ ward islands and south america , the national hurricane center said .
the eye of the major hurricane was about 1,@@ 6@@ 60 miles southwest of the a@@ zo@@ res in the n@@ hc 's 11 p.@@ m. ed@@ t update . the storm was moving north@@ -@@ northwest at 14 mph with 145 mph maximum sustained winds .
the storm isn 't forecast to make land@@ fall in the coming days , though a turn toward the northeast saturday could bring loren@@ zo near the a@@ zo@@ res in the middle of next week . forec@@ asters predict the storm will weaken below category 3 on monday .
sw@@ ells generated by the storm could cause life@@ -@@ threatening surf and rip currents in the wind@@ ward islands and northeastern south america .
loren@@ zo is the season 's second category 4 or higher storm . d@@ orian reached category 5 status near the ba@@ hamas .

patriot missile system to saudi arabia after iran oil attacks
u.s. soldiers talk after a routine inspection of a patriot missile battery at a turkish military base in ga@@ zi@@ ante@@ p , turkey .
the pentagon on thursday announced that the u.s. will send a patriot missile battery , rad@@ ars and roughly 200 support personnel to saudi arabia in the wake of the attacks on its oil facilities earlier this month .
defense secretary mark es@@ per has " approved putting additional forces on prepare to deploy orders , " pentagon spokesman jonathan ho@@ ffman wrote in a statement . " while no decision has been made to deploy these additional forces , they will maintain a heigh@@ tened state of readiness . "
those additional forces include two patriot missile artillery batteries and one terminal high altitude area defense , or tha@@ ad missile defense system .
tha@@ ad , one of the world 's most advanced missile systems , can target incoming missiles and blast them out of the sky . tha@@ ad intercep@@ tors , fired from a truc@@ k@@ -@@ based launcher , use kinetic energy to deliver " hit to kill " strikes to ballistic threats .
" it is important to note these steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners , and the security and stability in the middle east . other countries have called out iranian mis@@ adventures in the region , and we look for them to reinforce saudi arabia 's defense , " ho@@ ffman wrote .
president donald trump slammed iran 's alleged role in the attacks on saudi oil facilities , telling world leaders at the u.@@ n@@ . general assembly on tuesday that they should pressure tehran into diplomatic talks .
" all nations have a duty to act , " trump said regarding his call to counter iranian behavior . " no responsible government should subsidi@@ ze iran 's blood@@ lust . as long as iran 's men@@ ac@@ ing behavior continues , sanctions will not be lifted , they will be tightened . "
the sept . 14 strikes on the world 's largest cru@@ de@@ -@@ processing plant and oil field forced saudi arabia to shut down half of its production operations . the drone attacks triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a bud@@ ding conflict in the middle east . while tehran has been widely blamed for the attacks , it maintains that it was not involved .

'@@ hide@@ ous ' central coast camouflage child rap@@ ist ordered to look at victim in court
dressed in a leaf@@ y gh@@ il@@ lie camouflage suit , the man grabbed the then 12@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old from behind and dragged her into bush@@ land as she made her way to school on the state 's central coast in may 2017 .
he then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her .
shortly after the arrest , a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation .
the man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the gro@@ oming and sexual abuse of another girl , aged 11 , between august 2016 and april 2017 .
the 12@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife .
an example of a camouflage gh@@ il@@ lie suit the man used .
when she pleaded " stop , stop , stop , " he put her in a head@@ lock and forced her into the scrub .
the man told the girl : " sh@@ hh , don 't scream . don 't scream or i 'll have to hurt you . "
holding the knife in his right hand , he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before l@@ ashing her to the tree and ab@@ using her for almost an hour . after he cut her loose , the girl ran crying hyster@@ ically to school .
the man arrived at work about 9.@@ 30@@ am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues .
with dirt , grass and tree matter on his clothes , he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment .

no federal charges in fatal california police shooting
federal authorities declined to pursue civil rights charges thursday against sacra@@ men@@ to police officers who fat@@ ally shot an unarmed black man , a killing that sparked protests and spurred changes to a state law governing when authorities can use deadly force .
the u.s. attorney 's office and the fbi said a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old steph@@ on clark found " insufficient evidence " to pursue charges against officers terr@@ ance mer@@ cad@@ al and j@@ ared robin@@ et . both will be returned to active duty .
the california attorney general 's office in march declined to issue state criminal charges after a nearly year@@ long investigation . attorney general x@@ avi@@ er bec@@ erra said then evidence showed the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger because he was advancing toward them holding what they thought was a gun . investigators found only a cellphone .
sacra@@ men@@ to police also announced thursday their internal investigation did not find any policy or training violations .
" although no policy violations occurred in this incident or in the events leading up to it , we are committed to implementing strategies that may prevent similar trage@@ dies in the future , " sacra@@ men@@ to police chief daniel ha@@ hn said in a statement .
clark 's brother , ste@@ van@@ te clark , posted on facebook thursday that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities . " these people have failed when it comes to ( accountability ) , " he wrote .
authorities have said the officers believed clark was approaching them with a gun after he ran from them into his grandparents " backyard . the officers had been pursuing clark after receiving calls about someone breaking car windows and an elderly neighbor 's sliding glass door .
the officers shot clark seven times as he approached them .
the federal investigation looked at evidence such as witness statements , audio and video recordings , dispatch records , police reports , and autopsy reports to determine whether the officers acted will@@ fully with the intent to use objectively unreasonable force .
lawmakers last month updated the nation 's oldest law governing police use of deadly force , making it now among the country 's most comprehensive when combined with additional training .
california 's old standard made it rare for police officers to be charged following a shooting and ra@@ rer still for them to be convicted . it was based on the doctrine of " reasonable fear , " meaning if prosecutors or jur@@ ors believed officers had a reason to fear for their safety , they could use lethal force .
the new law , which takes effect jan@@ . 1 , will allow police to use deadly force only when " necessary " to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious injury to officers or by@@ stand@@ ers .
pope warns tech exec@@ s to use ai for the common good
pope francis on friday warned tech company executives , diplomats and financi@@ ers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good .
francis addressed a vatican conference that brought government en@@ voys and facebook and google representatives together with philosophers , physicists and eth@@ icists . a s@@ mat@@ tering of academics and catholic bish@@ ops rounded out participants at " the common good in the digital age " conference .
the three@@ -@@ day gathering is the latest evidence of the vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and per@@ ils of artificial intelligence .
the debates included technology adv@@ anc@@ ements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines , as well as a case study examining the christ@@ church , new zealand , massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the car@@ nage .
in his speech to the conference , francis praised the potential of technological progress , noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor . but he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depri@@ ving people of the dignity of labor .
" if technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities , it would not be true and real progress , " he warned . " if mankind 's so@@ -@@ called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good , this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbar@@ ism dic@@ tated by the law of the strongest . "
organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants " expertise identify possible future advisers for the catholic church on high tech issues .
the house voted friday to block the national emergency declaration president donald trump is using to fund his proposed border wall .
the democra@@ tic@@ -@@ held chamber passed a resolution to terminate trump 's action by a 23@@ 6@@ -@@ 17@@ 4 margin , sending it to the president . eleven republicans and one independent supported it . the senate already approved the measure in a 5@@ 4@@ -@@ 41 vote , as 11 republicans joined democrats in backing it .
trump will likely veto the resolution , the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president . he already ve@@ to@@ ed a measure to end the emergency declaration in march .
neither chamber of congress appears to have the two@@ -@@ thirds majority needed to override the president 's opposition .
failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the mexican government and congress , trump declared the national emergency in february . his administration plans to pull $ 3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects .
democrats have accused trump of both circum@@ venting congress ' power of the purse and ra@@ iding key defense funds for unnecessary barriers . a handful of republicans in both the house and senate also had concerns about the precedent trump 's declaration would set for executive over@@ reach in the future .
some senate republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote .

if you take the company 's incorporation date as its birthday , then google was born on september 4 , 1998 , however , the company never celebrated the day as its birthday , at least not in the form of a doo@@ dle . google celebrated september 7 as its birthday in doo@@ dles until 2005 , following which it switched to september 27 .
initially , the search engine was called " back@@ rub " and it was later renamed " google . "
" we chose our systems name , google , because it is a common spelling of goo@@ gol , or 10@@ 100 and fits well with our goal of building very lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale search engines , " serge@@ y br@@ in and lawrence ( larry ) page wrote in 1998 in a paper published about launching a prototype of a " lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale search engine . "
the company got its start thanks to sun co@@ -@@ founder andy be@@ ch@@ tol@@ shei@@ m who invested $ 100,000 ; in june 1999 , the company had raised a $ 25 million round from sequ@@ o@@ ia capital and kle@@ iner per@@ kins . google moved to its mountain view location in the same year , where it remains . in 2001 , the company was granted a patent for its technology .
what started out as a web search engine has since turned into a massive conglomer@@ ate that calls itself alphabet and google is a subsidiary company . today , google operates all over the world in over 100 languages , answering tril@@ lions of search queries each year .
" the relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do , " google writes on its our story page . " today , with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries , google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe , from youtube and android to smart@@ box and , of course , google search . although we 've dit@@ ched the le@@ go servers and added just a few more company dogs , our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us - from the dorm room , to the garage , and to this very day .
oil falls after iran claims us offered to remove sanctions , trump denies
iranian president hassan rou@@ hani makes a speech during a ceremony in tehran , iran on january 10 , 2019 .
oil slid after iranian president hassan rou@@ hani claimed friday that the u.s. offered to remove all sanctions on iran in exchange for negotiations . president donald trump and the state department later denied those claims , causing oil to rebound from the lows .
w@@ ti crude futures were last down by 0.9 % to $ 5@@ 5.@@ 91 after falling as low as $ 5@@ 4.@@ 79 . brent crude futures dropped 1.4 % to $ 6@@ 1.@@ 89 .
" the german chancellor , the prime minister of england ( britain ) and the president of france were in new york and all insisted that this meeting take place . and america says that it will lift the sanctions , " rou@@ hani said on his official website , according to reuters . " it was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they ( the united states ) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions . "
trump later said he responded " of course , no ! " to iran who he said wanted him to lift the sanctions in order to meet .
the state department called the report " bas@@ eless , " adding the u.s. is committed to zero oil exports from the iranian regime , bloomberg news said .
rou@@ hani 's comment came after a series of drones attacked oil facilities in saudi arabia on sept . 14 , which had forced the kingdom to cut production in half . the u.s. and some european countries , as well as saudi arabia , have blamed the attack on iran . tehran has denied any role in the incident . the trump administration also announced plans to deploy u.s. forces to the region .
the state department didn 't immediately respond to cn@@ bc 's request for comment .
" there 's been a big bear@@ ish risk from a tha@@ w in the us iran situation for some time and this will put a remarkable amount of oil back onto the market immediately if it were to occur , " said john kil@@ du@@ ff of again capital .
" it 's not just iranian production and exports . its ' millions of barrels in floating storage and millions of barrels sitting in china 's ports waiting to be processed by customs , " kil@@ du@@ ff said .
trump last year withdrew the u.s. from a nuclear deal between iran , the u.s. and five other countries that removed sanctions from the country in return for its commitment to end its nuclear .
the islamic republic , a target of u.s. sanctions for decades , was blamed by washington for recent attacks on oil tan@@ kers in the strait of hor@@ mu@@ z , which tehran denies . iran also shot down a u.s. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected u.s. spies .

royal news : how princess beat@@ rice " reacted with fury at hostile family members "
on thursday , the duke and duchess of york announced that their eldest daughter , princess beat@@ rice , is engaged to her boyfriend , the 34@@ -@@ year old property tycoon e@@ do@@ ardo ma@@ p@@ elli moz@@ zi . the princess , who is nin@@ th@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ line to the throne , will tie the knot with mr ma@@ p@@ elli moz@@ zi next year . the couple said in a statement : " we are both so excited to be embar@@ king on this life adventure together .
" we share so many similar interests and values , and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead , full of love and happiness . "
princess beat@@ rice 's parents , prince andrew and sarah ferguson , also shared their excitement .
the duchess of york wrote on twitter : " i know what a mother feels so i have tears of joy . i am so proud of this sensational news .
" andrew and i are just the luc@@ ki@@ est people ever to have two great sons in law . "
the royal wedding will be another occasion for the entire royal family to get together , and hopefully completely repair fer@@ gie 's relationship with the duke of edinburgh .
since sarah was embro@@ iled in one of the royal family 's biggest ever scandals , her relationship with the rest of the members has been extremely difficult .
five months after announcing she was separating from prince andrew in 1992 , compromising photographs of her with her " financial advisor " were taken at her holiday villa in st tro@@ pez .
the sn@@ aps appeared to show tex@@ an millionaire john br@@ yan kissing and sucking the duchess " toes and the arch of her foot , and prince philip in particular , is said to have had the strongest reaction to her daugh@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ law 's scand@@ al@@ ous an@@ tics .
however , his behaviour was reportedly " app@@ alling " towards the duchess of york , and princess beat@@ rice once claimed her mother was the victim of " mean spirited actions to make her feel un@@ welcome . "
just in : kate and william behind closed doors : couple 's shock habit exposed
the report noted that the duchess " spokesman was unable to comment on the claims , but a friend of fer@@ gie was quoted as saying : " it is no secret that sarah 's daughters are pretty fed up by the way their mother has been treated by some members of the royal family .
" some of the bills she has been sent have been pretty mis@@ erly .
" they are constantly ber@@ ating their father for allowing it to happen and beat@@ rice in particular has been impl@@ oring prince andrew to see that their mother is not treated as an out@@ cast . "
philip and sarah were pictured for the first time together in 26 years at princess eu@@ gen@@ ie 's wedding to jack brook@@ s@@ bank last october .
the next big labor strike hits oregon
the state university workers " most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work . the pay dispar@@ ities alone are shocking . about half of these workers earn less than $ 40,000 per year ( and hundreds make less than $ 25,000 ) . meanwhile , university presidents " annual salaries average out to $ 500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $ 1 million . while school administrators enjoy six@@ -@@ figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to blo@@ at , one in six classified sta@@ ff@@ ers qualify for food stamps .
as ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro se@@ gur@@ ra , another it worker at portland state university , said , " i 'm willing to go on strike because i don 't think it 's fair that people are paid wages that don 't allow them to live in the city that they serve . " portland state library worker the@@ resa sta@@ ple@@ burg was even more direct : " i want to strike because i 've been here 24 years , and i need a raise - a living wage . "
as inflation clim@@ bs and the cost of living in oregon so@@ ars , these workers are being left to fl@@ oun@@ der , and management has shown little sympathy for their plight . contract negotiations that began in february broke down in mid@@ -@@ august . at that point , the bosses had laid out some particularly e@@ gre@@ gious proposals - a pal@@ try cost@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ living increase , a denial of seni@@ ority demands from long@@ -@@ term university workers , and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as dis@@ respectful , and even cruel . " there is an un@@ written class system at the universities , " ful@@ mer said . " and we are at the bottom of it . "
" education workers have been under attack for decades , " he continued . " we are finally standing up and fighting back . it 's one thing to see class@@ ism and the squeezing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively obscene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation . but for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate . "
and oregon 's state university workers aren 't the only ones taking action . oregon is a powder ke@@ g of milit@@ ancy right now , and its fuse is now burning bright and hot . grocery store workers at the fred meyer supermarket chain are ram@@ ping up their campaign against their employer , and while there are no official plans to strike yet , tensions are running high ; their union , united food and commercial workers local 5@@ 55 , has already called for a boycott , and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain .
in the healthcare sector , the 4,@@ 500 members of the service employees international union local 49 workers at ka@@ iser perman@@ ent@@ e authorized a strike ( with a 98 percent approval rate ) if a deal isn 't reached before their existing contract expires in october - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement . elsewhere in the industry , the oregon nurses association , which represents more than 120 nurses at a@@ stor@@ ia hospital , has been dead@@ locked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration ; their last contract expired in may , and the clock is tic@@ king .
" oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up , " bur@@ ley explains . " this is a part of the national wave of labor growth . people are seeing a pre@@ car@@ ious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace . "
it 's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall , but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the northwest in 2019 . and from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further , into the heart of mid@@ western farming , southern manufacturing , tex@@ an oil fields , ap@@ pal@@ ach@@ ian coal mines , northeastern construction , the silicon valley tech giants , and everywhere in between . lord knows that something 's gotta give .
civ@@ ility in politics : new awards scheme set up to counter west@@ minster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
a new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work .
it comes after a di@@ vis@@ ive week in west@@ minster following the return of parliament .
it was marked by threats against mps and outrage over the language used by the likes of prime minister boris johnson .
to counter the division , the " civ@@ ility in politics " awards were announced on friday , with the politician of the year to be awarded £ 3,000 to give to charity .
boris johnson has been critic@@ ised for the tone of language he has used in the commons chamber
lord stewart , announcing the awards , said : " everyone agrees that politics in the uk is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civ@@ ility .
" as divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around brexit , we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirr@@ oring these trends , but by buc@@ king them .
" these awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persu@@ as@@ ions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with dec@@ ency and civ@@ ility , and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all . "
nom@@ inations will open on saturday , with an award ceremony in march next year .
in an exclusive interview with the standard , former cabinet minister amber rud@@ d today accused mr johnson of deploying aggressive language that " does inc@@ ite violence . "
mr johnson , for his part , said he " deplo@@ res " threats made against mps .
jess phillips ' frightened ' after receiving ' be afraid ' death threats
on thursday , labour mp jess phillips - another one of those to have critic@@ ised mr johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to " kick the door " of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a " fascist . "
liberal democrat leader jo s@@ win@@ son , meanwhile , was speaking to police following threats made to one of her young children .
and in a viral twitter thread , ellie cooper , the daughter of senior labour mp y@@ ve@@ tte cooper , described her fears for her mother in the wake of ms cox 's murder . she accused mr johnson of " using language that helps inc@@ ite violence toward mps . "
setting the example ? income inequality in the us is at an all@@ -@@ time high
last year the income gap between richest and poorest people in the us stood at its highest level since 1967 , the first year the census bureau started tracking it . dc and new york are among places where the differences are worst .
the us may be the world 's weal@@ thiest nation , but it is also one where the super@@ -@@ rich thrive no matter what while the desperately poor often rely on go@@ fun@@ d@@ me to pay their medical bills . the economic inequality affects both wealth and incomes , with the latter being at an all@@ -@@ time high .
one way to measure income inequality is the gin@@ i index . it measures between 0 , a score for absolute equality and 1 , which stands for a hypothetical situation in which a single household gets all income in a nation . the census bureau has been tracking the index for over 50 years . in 1967 it stood at 0.@@ 3@@ 97 but , in 2018 , it rose to 0.@@ 4@@ 85 , the highest figure on the record .
there are nations with worse income inequalities , including some with reasonably strong economies . for example , the world bank estimates that south africa 's gin@@ i index stood at 0.@@ 63 in 2014 while brazil 's was 0.@@ 53 in 2017 . by comparison , all eu countries have a gin@@ i index below 0.4 .
the new data shows that income inequality is most acute in places where wealth is concentrated , including dc , new york and connecticut , as well as in pover@@ ty@@ -@@ ridden areas like puerto rico and louisiana . utah , alaska , iowa , north dakota and south dakota had the most economic equality .
the census also showed a stag@@ n@@ ating growth of median household income , which grew to over $ 6@@ 2,000 . it 's the highest level ever measured by the american community survey , but the increase was just 0.8 from 2017 to 2018 , much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years and amoun@@ ting to virtually no growth at all if adjusted to inflation .
the new statistics will likely put some wind into the sails of progressive democratic conten@@ ders for the party nomination for next year 's presidential election , who call for leaning on the super@@ -@@ wealthy individuals and on big corporations to pay more taxes .
it may also undermine the ration@@ ale behind the current administration 's corporate tax breaks , which were passed through congress in 2017 . the goal was to convince multin@@ ation@@ als to bring back manufacturing jobs as money trick@@ les down to the middle and poor classes . in practice , it seems , it led to extra bonuses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment . well , someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips .

earlier this month , the sun revealed that tri@@ stan bought kh@@ lo@@ e a £ 400,000 porsche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of drake .

" drake told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win kh@@ lo@@ e back .
" an invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sleek super@@ car .

stem cells of 56 child cancer patients lost at children 's hospital after freezer malfunction
a freezer malfunction at children 's hospital los angeles resulted in the loss of 56 children 's blood stem cells that were harvested at the beginning of each patient 's onc@@ ology therapy and stored in the event they could prove useful in the future .
" we apologize for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families , " the hospital wrote in a statement . " if you have not received a letter or phone call from our team , your child is not impacted . "
all but one patient had gone through initial therapy . that patient did require the recoll@@ ection of stem cells , chief medical officer james stein said .
a letter sent to families earlier in september in@@ forming them of the loss was accidentally addressed to the children - rather than the parents . the hospital has also apologized to parents for the messaging oversight .
the hospital said that the loss of stem cells , which had been placed in long@@ -@@ term storage , has not jeopardi@@ zed any child 's health . the hospital has also offered to assist families who want to harvest again . but the process can be gru@@ eling .
one of the patients described it as " painful . " sean anderson corona , 13 , underwent stem cell therapy when he was diagnosed with stage 4 neuro@@ bla@@ stoma - a cancer often found in the adrenal glands . the boy was hooked up to machines for a day@@ long process that collects the stem cells from the blood . the blood is then re@@ inf@@ used back into the body .
" i would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking , and then i just started to freak out and i 'd start crying , " corona told abc@@ -@@ 7 .
corona will be cancer@@ -@@ free for three years in november . but his mother , elizabeth anderson , said that she worries that if his cancer does return , it may be impossible to harvest more stem cells from his blood .
stein said that the recoll@@ ection of patients " stem cells would only be recommended in the event that they are needed in the event that the patient relap@@ ses .
" we think that 's going to be incredibly unlikely so we wouldn 't ask anyone to do that in advance , " he said .
the freezer has since been replaced , and the sen@@ sor@@ -@@ monitoring and alert system have been upgraded .
" obviously , this is a huge deal for us . " stein said . " we 're reaching out directly to every single family in person to make sure that all their questions are answered . "

thomas cook pension trus@@ tees plot deal to salvage pa@@ youts
thomas cook 's pension funds have kicked off talks with specialist insurers about a deal to salvage the collapsed travel group 's retirement scheme benefits .
sky news has learnt that steve southern , chair of the trus@@ tees , is holding talks with several parties about a buy@@ out deal that would avoid most of thomas cook 's 14@@ ,000 pension scheme members facing a steep cut to their payments .
any deal with an insurer would be likely to involve a more modest cut to pa@@ youts than the 10 % triggered by a pension scheme 's transfer into the pension protection fund ( pp@@ f ) life@@ boat .
the discussions are at a very preliminary stage and - even if successful - will not result in a deal until after the thomas cook schemes have been through an assessment by the pp@@ f .
thomas cook bosses face investigation into what led to collapse
that period could take up to two years , and if the schemes do enter the pp@@ f will result in roughly 10,000 future pen@@ sion@@ ers having their pa@@ youts cut by 10 % .
sources said that a number of pension risk transfer specialists , as well as at least one of the new " super@@ fund " consolidation vehicles , were in talks with thomas cook 's trus@@ tees about a deal .
news of the trus@@ tees ' efforts to secure members ' benefits comes four days after britain 's oldest tour operator ceased trading , spar@@ king an international repatriation programme and triggering thousands of job losses .
thomas cook 's descent into in@@ solvency has sparked a bitter blame game , with board members , government ministers and auditors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse .
the company 's four pension schemes are well@@ -@@ funded , with a £ 100@@ m surplus on a pp@@ f basis , according to the latest figures .
collectively , they hold assets worth about £ 1.@@ 5@@ bn .
however , as sky news revealed last month , the trus@@ tees ' demands for better terms in thomas cook 's proposed rescue deal added a further complication to efforts to get the transaction across the line .
thomas cook 's liquidation brought to an end 17@@ 8 years of solvent trading , prompting the launch of inquiries by the government 's in@@ solvency service , the accounting watch@@ dog and an influential committee of mps .
ministers have established a tas@@ k@@ force to address the crisis , which has left creditors facing me@@ ag@@ re returns from the post@@ -@@ in@@ solvency sale of assets .
to date , just under half of thomas cook 's overseas british customers have been flown home .
its collapse came hours after thomas cook issued a last@@ -@@ gas@@ p plea to its lenders to reduce a £ 200@@ m funding demand .
what went so wrong for thomas cook ?
the talks , which concluded without a deal on sunday evening , represented a fran@@ tic last throw of the dice for a company which had been forced to seek more than £ 1@@ bn in new funding following a £ 1.@@ 5@@ bn half@@ -@@ year loss and deteriorating trading .
thomas cook was founded in 18@@ 41 by a 3@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old cab@@ in@@ et@@ -@@ maker and former baptist pre@@ acher who began offering one@@ -@@ day rail ex@@ cur@@ sions from le@@ ic@@ ester to l@@ ough@@ borough for a sh@@ illing .
from there , it went on to become one of the world 's largest holiday companies , marking its 17@@ 5@@ th anniversary three years ago .
a pp@@ f spokesperson said : " in@@ solvency events , like the liquidation of thomas cook , are exactly why the pp@@ f was set up .
" we are here to protect the financial futures of members belonging to defined benefit pension schemes and they should take comfort knowing we are here to protect them . "
a spokesman for thomas cook 's pension trus@@ tees declined to comment on friday .
adorable pictures show new@@ -@@ born rh@@ ino nu@@ zzling her mother and exploring new home
baby stella was welcomed into the world at co@@ t@@ sw@@ old wildlife park , ox@@ ford@@ shire , earlier this month and is the first female born to parents mon@@ ty and ruby .
the young@@ ster , who is healthy and nursing well , can be seen wondering about her enclosure before resting alongside her mother on a bed of straw .
mother ruby joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called nancy in the hope that one would produce the park 's first ever calf with mon@@ ty .
nancy then gave birth to a female named astri@@ d in 2013 , with stella being the third female calf born at the park in its 4@@ 9@@ -@@ year history .
jamie craig , curator of co@@ t@@ sw@@ old wildlife park , said : ' we have had tremendous success with our current rh@@ ino herd .
'@@ stella is the sixth young@@ ster from nancy and ruby and our bull , mon@@ ty , has proved to be an excellent dad .
'@@ he is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patri@@ arch .
'@@ it is particularly satisfying that ruby has produced a female calf - these are vital for the development of the breeding programme and stella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself . '
ruby has had two boys before , ian in 2015 and alan in 2017 . alan is still at the park whilst ian is in tor@@ ino zoo in italy
when alan was just one@@ -@@ week old he weighed around eleven stone .
births in cap@@ tivity are considered extremely rare . females only reproduce every two@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half to five years , so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited .
according to the park , a typical ge@@ station period lasts between sixteen to eighteen months , after which a single calf is born .
it is considered the longest ge@@ station periods of any land mammal , surpassed only by the tw@@ ent@@ y@@ -@@ two month ge@@ station period of an elephant .
a newborn rh@@ ino calf will stand up within one hour of birth . once born , the calf will immediately attempt to suc@@ kle , although he or she may be a little unsteady on their feet for the first few days .
it will remain under the watch@@ ful eye of the mother , suc@@ kling from her for approximately one year .
their bond is an inten@@ sely strong one and the calf will remain with its mother for at least two years , benefiting from her protection . females guard their offspring aggressively and are intim@@ id@@ ating ad@@ vers@@ aries if challenged .
in@@ cel virgin alex min@@ assi@@ an told toronto police he was part of 4@@ chan group
footage has emerged of a man alleged to have killed 10 pedestrians in toronto telling police that he was part of an online group for sexually frustrated men .
al@@ ek min@@ assi@@ an , 26 , said that he was part of the involun@@ tary cel@@ i@@ bates ( in@@ cel ) forum on 4@@ chan .
he is now facing 10 counts of murder in canada and 16 counts of attempted murder following the attack on april 23 , 2018 .
when asked about the deaths , he told police : " i feel like i accomplished my mission . "
when the incident happened , it brought attention to the online world of loneliness , rage and mis@@ og@@ y@@ ny .
min@@ assi@@ an said that he had contact with a killer in california who was angry at women who had rejected him .
he stands accused of driving a rental van into crowds of pedestrians in a busy north toronto neighbourhood . eight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 died .
min@@ assi@@ an has yet to enter a plea . his trial begins in february , but a publication ban on his interrogation by police was lifted today . the police interview took place just hours after the attack .
min@@ assi@@ an , who said he never had a girlfriend and was a virgin , acknowledged he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks .
he said : " i know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way , " but added that they are " too co@@ wardly to act on their anger . "
min@@ assi@@ an calls himself an " in@@ cel , " short for " involun@@ tary cel@@ ib@@ ate .

us theater chain bans dressing up for " jo@@ ker " screen@@ ings over fears of another shooting
the largest us independent theater chain won 't let people in cos@@ play watch the critically accla@@ imed origin story of batman super@@ villain " jo@@ ker . " face paint and masks are already banned , but safety fears still remain .
most us cinemas have banned masks , face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in aurora , colorado , which happened during a screening of another batman fl@@ ick , " the dark knight rises . " the gunman wore a jo@@ ker costume when he went on a gun and tear@@ -@@ gas ram@@ page , killing 12 people and injuring 70 others . body costumes that don 't hide a person 's identity , however , have been generally allowed in theaters .
however , landmark theaters has now announced that it will not allow customers to wear costumes during screen@@ ings of the r@@ -@@ rated " jo@@ ker . "
" i want customers to be comfortable in their surroundings , " landmark president@@ -@@ ceo ted mun@@ dor@@ ff told the hollywood reporter .
the company is based in los@@ -@@ angeles and runs 52 theaters in 27 markets , which makes it the biggest specialized theater chain in the country .
meanwhile , kans@@ as@@ -@@ based am@@ c theat@@ res , the largest chain in the country , reiterated its ban on " masks , face paint or any object that conce@@ als the face , " but said they will welcome viewers in costume .
the ban on masks and fake guns was mostly due to practical security reasons , but as the release of " jo@@ ker " draws closer , there are concerns that it may trigger a copy@@ cat gun attack . the lap@@ d said it would " maintain high visibility " around theaters on premier day , while reg@@ al cinemas , the second@@ -@@ largest chain in the country , said it was implementing security protocols developed " in collaboration with nato . "
the us army went as far as advis@@ ing service members to watch out for " inc@@ els , " dis@@ grun@@ tled males who can 't get a date , who supposedly id@@ ol@@ ize the jo@@ ker and may mimic his brutal ways .
" jo@@ ker , " which is directed by todd phillips and stars jo@@ aqu@@ in phoenix as the title character , is due to be released on october 4 in the us , and is expected to become a box office hit . it follows the descent of a socially isolated and mentally un@@ well person , as he becomes the mass@@ -@@ mur@@ dering , green@@ -@@ haired , pale@@ -@@ faced ne@@ mes@@ is of batman .
it received ra@@ ve reviews at its venice international film festival premiere this year , taking the top prize . the film is a psychological thr@@ iller loosely based on the comic book series . some comm@@ enters voiced concerns that it may cause harm by depic@@ ting the protagonist in a sympathetic way and including graphic and realistic violence . however , the creative team behind it said their work is meant for mature audiences who are expected to be able to tell right from wrong .
mid@@ way broadcasting announced today that its chair@@ woman , melody span@@ n cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entrepreneurs and executives thrive in business . " the girlfriend 's guide to closing the deal " shares insights on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old@@ -@@ boy 's network .
throughout the book , span@@ n cooper uses anec@@ do@@ tal references to deal with challenging issues including the # me@@ too movement and hillary clinton 's presidential defeat and its impact on fu@@ eling the female empowerment in america .
the self@@ -@@ published book is the result of a ground@@ breaking self@@ -@@ entitled speech that span@@ n cooper delivered as a keynote address at the national association of women business owners conference in chicago in 2017 . the girlfriend 's guide to closing the deal is written in a down@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ earth style that every " girlfriend " can relate .
christie he@@ f@@ ner , business@@ woman and daughter of playboy founder , hugh he@@ f@@ ner , says " the girlfriend 's guide to closing the deal " is both highly entertaining and very helpful . melody wea@@ ves together personal anec@@ do@@ tes , trium@@ phs , and setbacks with useful lessons learned . from how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to " friend up , " everyone can benefit from melody 's story .

romania invests billions in a black sea military base
romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modern@@ ize the black sea military base as part of counter@@ acting russia 's growing presence in the region , according to the times , quoted by the focus news agency . mik@@ hail k@@ og@@ lig@@ ni@@ chan@@ u air@@ base , located about 200 k@@ m. east of bu@@ ch@@ arest , will be aligned with nato standards , as evi@@ d@@ enced by documents published by local news sites . up to 10,000 nato f@@ -@@ 35 soldiers and aircraft can be accommo@@ dated there . it is planned to become a " mini@@ -@@ city " for the military with kindergartens , sports clubs and a hospital .
the base has already become a center of increased nato activity in the black sea , which has become a key area of tension between russia and the west . after moscow anne@@ xed crimea from ukraine in 2014 , the kremlin began to increase its naval presence in the black sea , using the deep@@ -@@ sea base in sev@@ a@@ stop@@ ol to carry out naval missions in syria . russia is also ham@@ pering shipping in the region and last year captured three ukrainian ships in the ker@@ ch strait .
romania and bulgaria , located on the black sea coast , which in the past were allies of the us@@ sr , have joined nato and the eu since its collapse . in response to russia 's actions , they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region , writes the times . in february , 500 us troops arrived at romania 's air base . an euro@@ fighter typhoon fighter squadron of the british air force is stationed and deployed . since april last year , these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted russian fighter jets . georgia , located on the eastern black sea coast , is also concerned about russia 's aspirations . it is not a member of the alliance , but is involved in nato military exercises . nato secretary general j@@ ens stol@@ ten@@ berg said during a visit to t@@ bil@@ isi in march that the alliance was " preparing " georgia for accession . ukraine has also participated in nato exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the union since 2014 .
ukraine , the " new berlin wall , " once again lies at the center of scandal
mr. poro@@ shenko 's eag@@ er@@ ness to win over mr. trump and his growing fears that political rivals would th@@ wart his re@@ -@@ election opened the way for mr. gi@@ u@@ lian@@ i to press ukraine 's prosecutor general , yuri lu@@ t@@ sen@@ ko , who has since been fired , to help mr. trump 's own re@@ -@@ election by investigating joe biden and his son .
how mr. poro@@ shenko expected the trump administration to help lift his sag@@ ging fortunes ahead of ukraine 's presidential election , held in two rounds in march and april this year , is unclear . he got tr@@ ounced anyway , losing emphatically to mr. z@@ el@@ en@@ sky , whose own officials quickly became the trump team 's new targets in its drive to damage mr. biden .
while democrats want mr. trump impe@@ ached over his dealings with ukraine , the president and his allies have counter@@ attacked with their own ukra@@ ine@@ -@@ focused scandals . they have revived a deb@@ un@@ ked theory that the country coll@@ uded with the clinton campaign to hurt mr. trump 's chances in 2016 and asser@@ ted , with little evidence , that mr. biden used his position as vice president to prevent ukraine from investigating his son .
ukra@@ inians , j@@ aded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileges of office for personal financial or political gain , have mostly shru@@ gged off what , for mr. trump , is possibly the most serious scandal to buffet the white house since water@@ gate top@@ pled president richard nixon in 1974 .
that a country few americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in washington has stirred mostly be@@ mus@@ ement in ukraine . those feelings are also ting@@ ed with a touch of pride that , after centuries in the shadow of russia , its giant neighbor to the north , the nation is no longer seen as a back@@ water but a pivot around which the fate of the world 's most powerful country im@@ pla@@ usi@@ bly turns .
pav@@ lo k@@ lim@@ kin , ukraine 's foreign minister under mr. poro@@ shenko , said in a caus@@ tic twitter message this week that going down in history " as the country that led to the impeachment of the u.s. president " was " not a very fun prospect . " but , he added , " now everyone understands what we are capable of . "
brother j@@ ailed for life for pakistan social media star q@@ ande@@ el bal@@ o@@ ch 's honour killing
q@@ ande@@ el bal@@ o@@ ch , who shot to fame for her social media photos , was strang@@ led in july 2016 .
the brother of pakistani social media star q@@ ande@@ el bal@@ o@@ ch was on friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarch@@ al country 's high@@ est@@ -@@ profile " honour killing . "
bal@@ o@@ ch , who shot to fame for her ris@@ que sel@@ fies -@@ - tame by western standards , but considered provocative in deeply mis@@ og@@ yn@@ istic pakistan -@@ - was strang@@ led in july 2016 .
her brother muhammad was@@ e@@ em was arrested . days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did , saying that " of course " he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been " in@@ tolerable . "
his lawyer , sar@@ dar me@@ h@@ mood , told afp the court in the eastern city of mul@@ tan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment , in a long@@ -@@ awaited verdict .
" in@@ sh@@ allah ( god willing ) , he will be acqu@@ itted by a high court , " he said .
earlier , bal@@ o@@ ch 's mother an@@ war mai told afp she had hoped her son would be acqu@@ itted .
" he is innocent . she was my daughter and he is my son , " she said .
bal@@ o@@ ch 's murder made international headlines and re@@ ignited calls for action against an epidemic of so@@ -@@ called " honour killings , " in which a victim -@@ - usually a woman -@@ - is murdered for fl@@ outing patriarch@@ al social codes .
women have been burned , shot , stabbed and strang@@ led for offences such as choosing their own husband or -@@ - in bal@@ o@@ ch 's case -@@ - bringing " shame " on their family by celebrating their sexuality .
the killings are usually carried out by a close relative . under pakistan 's q@@ is@@ as ( blood money ) and di@@ yat ( re@@ tribu@@ tion ) law , they can then seek forgiveness from a victim 's relatives .
three months after bal@@ o@@ ch 's murder , parliament passed new legislation man@@ dating life imprisonment for honour killings .
however , whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge 's discretion , meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be par@@ don@@ ed .
in bal@@ o@@ ch 's case , her parents initially insisted their son would be given no ab@@ solution .
but , heart@@ broken at the thought of losing him also , they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven .
international re@@ vul@@ sion at the killing had seen the pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents , however , forcing the case to move ahead .
some of bal@@ o@@ ch 's better@@ -@@ known actions included offering to perform a stri@@ p@@ tease for the pakistani cricket team , and don@@ ning a plun@@ ging scarlet dress on valentine 's day .
she attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many , including young people , as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a kim kar@@ dashi@@ an@@ -@@ like figure can be seen as a bold , political act of women 's empowerment .
the roots of " honour " killings lie in tribal social norms , which remain prevalent across south asia and dic@@ tate the behaviour of women in particular , though men can be victims too .
three scottish students named among europe 's best
three university of dun@@ dee students have been named regional winners as top graduates in europe .
the university of dun@@ dee students were named as top graduates in their respective fields in europe in the 2019 global undergraduate awards , whilst five other students from the same university were praised by the judges .
scott shel@@ dr@@ ick , who graduated in molecular genetics , won the europe award for life sciences , chester corn@@ ford studied ms@@ c mental health nursing and was awarded the nursing , mid@@ wi@@ fer@@ y & allied healthcare prize , whilst l@@ ola kni@@ bb won the visual arts award .
although all three made it through to the global final , they lost out in the final round to strong competition from some of the 3,500 entran@@ ts from across the world .
professor blair gru@@ bb , vic@@ e@@ -@@ principal ( education ) at the university , said : " to get to this stage , our students and graduates faced competition from peers attending some of the world 's top universities .
" the undergraduate awards are fiercely con@@ tested by thousands of students around the world and it is a great reflection of the quality of our students , and the education they receive here , that dun@@ dee is so strongly represented amongst the prize winners .
" i would like to offer my warm@@ est congratulations to scott , chester and l@@ ola on this fantastic achievement , alongside the other dun@@ dee representatives who were highly commended . "
another five students were commended in the world 's leading undergraduate awards programme , which recogn@@ ises top work completed by undergraduates to share this with a global audience .
included in the five praised students were nicholas gall@@ ag@@ her and james os@@ bourne ( both life sciences ) , feren@@ c ko@@ h@@ su@@ ke ishi@@ kawa gu@@ tai ( medicine ) , ca@@ it@@ lyn scott ( anatomical sciences ) and w@@ aco yok@@ oy@@ ama ( philosophy ) .

oldest galaxy proto@@ cluster forms ' queen 's court@@ '
using the subar@@ u , k@@ ec@@ k , and gemini telescopes , an international team of astronomers has discovered a collection of 12 galaxies which existed about 13.@@ 0 billion years ago . this is the earliest proto@@ cluster ever found . one of the 12 galaxies is a giant object , known as hi@@ mi@@ ko , which was discovered a decade ago by the subar@@ u telescope and named for a myth@@ ological queen in ancient japan . this discovery suggests that large structures such as proto@@ clusters already existed when the universe was only about 800 million years old , 6 percent of its present age .
in the present universe , galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of members , but how these clusters form is a big question in astronomy . to understand the formation of clusters , astronomers search for possible progen@@ itors in the ancient universe . a proto@@ cluster is a dense system of dozens of galaxies in the early universe , growing into a cluster .
yu@@ i@@ chi har@@ i@@ kane , a j@@ sp@@ s fellow at the national astronomical observatory of japan who led the team of astronomers explains , " a proto@@ cluster is a rare and special system with an extremely high density , and not easy to find . to overcome this problem , we used the wide field of view of the subar@@ u telescope to map a large area of the sky and look for proto@@ clusters . "
in the map of the universe made by the subar@@ u telescope , the team discovered a proto@@ cluster candidate , z@@ 66@@ od , where galaxies are 15 times more concentrated than normal for that era . the team then conducted follow@@ -@@ up spectro@@ scopic observations using the w@@ .@@ m. k@@ ec@@ k observatory and gemini north telescope , and confirmed 12 galaxies which existed 13.@@ 0 billion years ago , making it the earliest proto@@ cluster known to date .
interestingly , one of the 12 galaxies in z@@ 66@@ od was a giant object with a huge body of gas , known as hi@@ mi@@ ko , which was found previously by the subar@@ u telescope in 2009 . " it is reasonable to find a proto@@ cluster near a massive object , such as hi@@ mi@@ ko . however , we 're surprised to see that hi@@ mi@@ ko was located not in the center of the proto@@ cluster , but on the edge 500 million light@@ -@@ years away from the center . " said mas@@ ami ou@@ chi , a team member at the national astronomical observatory of japan and the university of tokyo , who discovered hi@@ mi@@ ko in 2009 . ironically , the myth@@ ological queen hi@@ mi@@ ko is also said to have lived clo@@ istered away from her people . ou@@ chi continues , " it is still not understood why hi@@ mi@@ ko is not located in the center . these results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies .

warren 's lemon@@ ade money went to a pro@@ -@@ life charity
when sen@@ . elizabeth warren ( d. , mass . ) purchased drinks from two girls running a lemon@@ ade stand in august , she may not have been aware that her $ 10 purchase would be donated to a pro@@ -@@ life charity .
" our daughters thought [ warren ] was nice , " dan mich@@ els , a trump supporter and a father to one of the girls , told the washington free beacon . " she came by and told us we should vote for her . and our daughters told us she was a nice person , but we don 't align with her politically and ... because she 's pro@@ -@@ choice , we said we should donate her money to a pro@@ -@@ life [ cause ] . "
on august 8 , warren stopped by a lemon@@ ade stand sta@@ ffed by two 11@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old children , si@@ en@@ na mich@@ els and audrey bill@@ ings , during a campaign bus tour across iowa .
" stopped for a quick drink at a lemon@@ ade stand in har@@ lan , iowa . when life gives you le@@ mons , make big structural change ! " warren said on twitter .
the two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person . the mich@@ els girl urged her parents to vote for the massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op . the parents instead explained warren 's stance on abortion . the girls and their parents decided to donate to the march for life education and defense fund , a non@@ -@@ profit that supports pro@@ -@@ life legislation .
" my daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her , " mich@@ els said . " we talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion , and my daughter was all for that . "
why viruses like herpes and zi@@ ka will need to be re@@ classified : bio@@ tech impact
new research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be re@@ tool@@ ed , because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood . the findings could have significant impact on how they are classified , our understanding of how they form , evolve and infect hosts , and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them .
in the 19@@ 50@@ s and ' 60@@ s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses , they discovered the detailed structure of the cap@@ sid -@@ - an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -@@ - which protects the virus ' genetic material . the majority of viruses have cap@@ si@@ ds that are typically qu@@ asi@@ -@@ spherical and display ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral symmetry -@@ - like a 20@@ -@@ sided dice for instance .
the cap@@ sid shell is what protects them , and as scientists discovered their structure , they proposed that cap@@ si@@ ds could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome , and therefore could infect hosts differently .
why this matters
when designing drugs to target viruses , scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy .
two researchers who study the structures of viruses , ant@@ oni lu@@ que , a theoretical bi@@ ophy@@ sic@@ ist at san diego state university and a member of its viral information institute , and rei@@ dun tw@@ ar@@ ock , a mathematical biologist from the university of york , uk , and a member of york 's cross@@ -@@ disciplinary centre for systems analysis , show that many viruses have essentially been mis@@ classified for 60 years , including common viruses such as herpes sim@@ plex and zi@@ ka .
this was because despite having the structural images from cry@@ o@@ -@@ electron microscopy , we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architec@@ tures of different viruses .
" we discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ sid shells , " lu@@ que said . " so , many viruses don 't adopt only the two broadly understood cap@@ sid architec@@ tures . there are now at least eight ways in which their ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ si@@ ds could be designed . "
they used a generalization of the qu@@ as@@ ie@@ qui@@ valence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ sid .
their study , which will be published in nature communications on friday , september 27 , also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural line@@ age , based on the protein that they 're composed of , adopt consistent ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ sid la@@ youts , providing a new approach to study virus evolution .
bio@@ tech applications
structural biologists can now take this information and re@@ classify the structure of the viruses , which will help unve@@ il molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses .
it will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nano@@ tech and bio@@ tech applications , and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the cap@@ sid . this can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing anti@@ viral vaccines .
" we can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the cap@@ sid , to either prevent the formation of the virus when it inf@@ ects the host cell , or break it apart after it 's formed , " lu@@ que said . " this could facilitate the characterization and identification of anti@@ viral targets for viruses sharing the same ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral layout . "
this new framework accommo@@ dates viruses that were previously out@@ li@@ ers , provides new predictions of viral cap@@ sid architec@@ tures , and has identified common geometrical patterns among distant evolutionary related viruses that infect everyone from humans to bacteria .
tw@@ ar@@ ock said the new blue@@ prints also provide " a new perspective on viral evolution , suggesting novel routes in which larger and more complex viruses may have evolved from simple ones at evolutionary tim@@ escal@@ es . "
architectural applications
the geome@@ tries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction .
since the 196@@ 0@@ s , these viral cap@@ si@@ ds have been classified using the geometrical framework introduced by structural biologist donald cas@@ par and bi@@ ophy@@ sic@@ ist aaron k@@ lu@@ g , which were inspired by the geo@@ des@@ ic dom@@ es designed by the renowned architect r@@ . buck@@ minster fuller . however , as molecular imaging techniques have advanced , an increasing number of 3@@ d viral cap@@ sid re@@ construc@@ tions that included viruses like herpes or zi@@ ka have fallen out from this classical geometrical framework .
" this study introduces a more general framework than the classic cas@@ par@@ -@@ k@@ lu@@ g construction . it is based on the conservation of the local ver@@ tices formed by the proteins that interact in the cap@@ sid , " lu@@ que explained . " this approach led to the discovery of six new types of ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dral cap@@ sid la@@ youts , while recovering the two classical la@@ youts from cas@@ par@@ -@@ k@@ lu@@ g based on gold@@ berg and geo@@ des@@ ic poly@@ he@@ dra .

priest who sexually abused boys in wisconsin gets 30 years
a former priest accused of sexually assaul@@ ting young boys in wisconsin decades ago has been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
the wa@@ us@@ au daily herald reports that 7@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old thomas er@@ ick@@ sen received the maximum sentence thursday on two charges of sexually assaul@@ ting young boys while stationed at st@@ . peter 's catholic church in winter in the late 70@@ s and early 80@@ s . he must register as a sex offender for life .
four men testified thursday about how the assa@@ ults affected their lives . one of the victims went public for the first time .
er@@ ick@@ sen apologized to the victims in court and said he has come to realize the impact the assa@@ ults had on victims . at least 11 men claim they were abused by er@@ ick@@ sen during his time in the cler@@ gy .
er@@ ick@@ sen was removed from the pri@@ es@@ thood in 1988 .
having too much of this spice could damage liver
made from the inner bark of the cinnam@@ om@@ um tree , cinnamon is a widely popular spice , earning itself a place in a large variety of food and even becoming a flavor itself .
and all for good reason since the spice is host to some very impressive health benefits , such as lowering the risk of life@@ -@@ threatening diseases like heart disease , cancer and even diabetes .
but hold your horses just yet since too much of a good thing can be harmful , very harmful . and in this case , here are some side effects one can get if they eat too much cinnamon . stay safe out there .
may increase the risk of cancer - unfortunately , while cinnamon can help lower the risk of cancer , it can also very much contribute to the development of it . per animal studies , consuming too much cou@@ mar@@ in , which is commonly found in cas@@ sia cinnamon , may increase the risk of cancer development . per scientists , cou@@ mar@@ in does this by supposedly damaging our dn@@ as over time .
may cause liver damage - per studies , too much cou@@ mar@@ in can also be responsible for liver toxicity and damage . this is according to several studies made on the effects of too much cou@@ mar@@ in in our bodies .
may cause mouth so@@ res - not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth so@@ res . this is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnam@@ aldehyde , which is a compound that when ing@@ ested in large amounts , can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies . however , one can only get mouth so@@ res from cinnam@@ aldehyde when they 're allergic from it .
may cause breathing problems - this is more of a general precaution since cinnamon 's fine texture makes it very easy to in@@ hale that may cause coughing and g@@ ag@@ ging as well as the cinnam@@ aldehyde in it acting as a throat irrit@@ ant .
may cause low blood sugar - for many people , cinnamon is helpful since it 's well known for having the ability to lower our blood sugar . this is good , especially for those who suffer from high blood sugar . however , too many of it can make our blood sugar fall too low , posing a new set of health risks .
tennessee 's abortion waiting period trial goes to judge
a federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over tennessee 's 48@@ -@@ hour waiting period law for abor@@ tions .
over the course of a four@@ -@@ day trial in n@@ ash@@ ville that concluded thursday , the state tried to show that the law , which requires women to make two separate trips to a clinic at least 48 hours apart , benefits women by allowing them time to reflect on their decisions . attor@@ neys representing five of the state 's seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and causes significant burdens .
experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abor@@ tions are uncertain , and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision . but they diffe@@ red on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abor@@ tions . the experts also disagreed on whether tennessee 's 48@@ -@@ hour waiting period would make any difference for those women .
on thursday , attor@@ neys for the state introduced a study from utah on the effects of a 7@@ 2@@ -@@ hour waiting period there . it found that 8 % of participating women who attended an initial coun@@ selling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion .
questioned about the study , ant@@ onia big@@ gs , a social psychologist researcher at the university of california san francisco , agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with . but she noted that the study did not find that utah 's mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women .
big@@ gs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems . she said a national study comparing women seeking abor@@ tions who were just under the cu@@ toff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cu@@ toff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post@@ -@@ traumatic stress .
under cross@@ -@@ examination big@@ gs said the study did not follow the mental health outcomes of women in states with waiting periods who changed their minds about having an abortion , although there were only three women like that identified in the study . she re@@ but@@ ted testimony from earlier in the week by pris@@ c@@ illa col@@ eman , a psychology professor at bowling green state university in ohio , who said that abortion is associated with mental health problems .
col@@ eman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically biased in favor of abor@@ tions .
thursday also included testimony for the state from a memphis obste@@ tr@@ ician and gynec@@ ologist who participates in a controversial network that attempts to halt the effects of abor@@ tion@@ -@@ inducing medication . dr. michael po@@ dra@@ za said that through that work he has " personal experience with women who have changed their minds about an abortion . "
tennessee 's waiting period law went into effect in mid@@ -@@ 2015 , and po@@ dra@@ za said he has seen several women since then who wanted to try to reverse a medical abortion that was already underway . some of those women then changed their minds a second time and followed through with the abortion , he testified . these revers@@ als happened in spite of the waiting period .
clinic directors previously testified the wait period causes women financial hardship and stress . they also said the two@@ -@@ visit requirement poses logis@@ tical challenges for patients and clinics that cause abor@@ tions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law , pushing some women into surgical abor@@ tions , which have greater risks of complications . a few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether .
tennessee is one of 14 states with laws requiring women to make two trips to an abortion clinic according to the gu@@ tt@@ ma@@ cher institute , a research group that supports abortion rights .
in determining whether tennessee 's waiting period violates the u.s. constitution , u.s. district judge bernard fre@@ id@@ man must determine whether it places an un@@ due burden on women seeking abortion . it 's a subjective standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others uph@@ eld , depending on the specific circumstances of the state .
after both sides rested their cases on thursday , fried@@ man said he would rule as quickly as possible .
french chemical fire extinguished as questions mount
french authorities and nor@@ mandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul sten@@ ch continues to spread over a s@@ wat@@ h of territory .
no one was injured in thursday 's fire at a lubricant plant in rou@@ en , but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby se@@ ine river .
the head of the regional administration said friday the fire was extinguished thursday night after nearly 24 hours . firefighters are still on the scene .
the administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out , saying it could spread to neighboring regions .
interior minister christop@@ he ca@@ stan@@ er said people in fragile health should remain indoors through friday night .
the cause of the fire is being investigated . the plant is among the high@@ est@@ -@@ risk industrial sites in europe .
lng investments hit record in 2019 & the biggest growth is coming from china
investments in liquefied natural gas since the start of the year have hit an all@@ -@@ time high of $ 50 billion , the international energy agency 's head , fati@@ h bi@@ rol , told an industry conference .
" this year , 2019 already broke the highest amount of ( final investment decisions ) for the first time ever , $ 50 billion , " bi@@ rol told the lng produc@@ er@@ -@@ consumer conference in tokyo , as quoted by reuters .
un@@ surprisingly , the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in asia , with china still expected to overtake japan as the world 's top importer of lng .
" the biggest growth is coming from china . in the next five years , about one@@ -@@ third of global lng demand will come from china alone , " bi@@ rol said . he added that in five years , china will become the largest importer of the fuel .
as for the growth in investments , there are no surprises there , either . the bulk of these has been made in the united states and canada .
in a december 2018 report the energy information administration said it expected the united states " lng export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.@@ 9 billion cu ft daily . this will make the us the third@@ -@@ largest exporter of lng in terms of capacity after qatar and australia . by 2030 , us lng exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily , from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019 .
in canada , there is just one lng project under development right now - lng canada - but it could have a final capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually . the us $ 3@@ 1@@ -@@ billion project is led by shell , with minority participants including pe@@ tr@@ onas , petrochina , mitsubishi , and k@@ og@@ as .
meanwhile , qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its number@@ -@@ one spot in the global lng export race . the country has lifted a mor@@ atorium on new drilling in its north field - the world 's largest offshore gas field qatar shares with iran - aiming to boost export capacity by 43 percent to 11 million tons annually .
global lng demand is seen at 550 million tons by 2030 , according to projections by i@@ hs mark@@ it .

the top leader and founder of colombia 's los pel@@ us@@ os crime gang has been killed in an operation led by the national police , president ivan du@@ que said on friday .
the gang is one of the most well@@ -@@ known criminal organizations in the an@@ dean country and involved in fighting that has endangered hundreds of thousands of people in areas along the eastern border with venezuela .
luis antonio qu@@ inter@@ o , known by his alias pac@@ ora , was a former lef@@ tist rebel who commanded some 4@@ 40 gang members , the government said .

'@@ how dare you ? ' th@@ un@@ berg 's u.@@ n@@ . speech inspi@@ res dutch climate protesters
thousands of dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on friday , blocking traffic and asking their leaders " how dare you ? " in a reference to swedish teenage activist gre@@ ta th@@ un@@ berg 's speech at the united nations .
a participant holds a drawing depic@@ ting swedish environmental activist gre@@ ta th@@ un@@ berg during a protest march to call for action against climate change , in the hague , netherlands september 27 , 2019 . reuters / pi@@ ro@@ sch@@ ka van de wou@@ w
turnout at the march in the hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 3@@ 5,000 . police were forced to re@@ route the march to a location with more space .
th@@ un@@ berg , 16 , gave an imp@@ assi@@ oned address at the united nations in new york this week , after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last friday in the run@@ -@@ up to a u.@@ n@@ . climate summit .
" this strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up , not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life , " said prote@@ ster rein@@ der rus@@ tem@@ a .
bang@@ ing drums and holding pictures of th@@ un@@ berg , protesters walked through the city center with plac@@ ards reading : " for the gre@@ ta good , " " don 't be a fossil fool , " and " you will die of old age , we will die of climate change . "
" i understand their concerns , i believe they are being heard , " dutch prime minister mark ru@@ tte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within ear@@ shot of the protests . " we have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems . but we have to do it in a smart way , which also creates jobs . "
th@@ un@@ berg 's brief address electri@@ fied the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions , which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists .
" this is all wrong . i shouldn 't be up here . i should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope . how dare you ? " she said , her voice qua@@ vering with emotion .
the netherlands , with 17 million inhabitants , generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017 , compared to 15 percent in germany and over half of all energy in sweden .
the government has pledged to hal@@ ve co@@ 2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 , but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut .

military sees frustrating trend as su@@ icides spike
military su@@ icides surged this year to a record high among active duty troops , continuing a deadly trend that pentagon officials say is frustrating and they are struggling to counter .
the army , navy and marine corps all saw the rate of su@@ icides go up as well as the overall numbers , with only the air force showing a decrease , according to data released by the pentagon thursday . su@@ icides among members of the reserves and the national guard also grew .
the difficulties involved in identifying service members with possible problems and finding ways to prevent su@@ icides were under@@ scored earlier this month when the navy reported that three crew members who served on the uss george h@@ .@@ w@@ . bush took their own lives within a week .
asked about the deaths in the crew of the aircraft carrier , defense secretary mark es@@ per said , " i wish i could tell you we have an answer to prevent further , future su@@ icides in the armed services . we don 't . we are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth . "
the number of su@@ icides across the military increased from 5@@ 11 in 2017 to 5@@ 41 in 2018 . according to the pentagon , the most at@@ -@@ risk population is young en@@ listed men , and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method . army su@@ icides went from 114 to 1@@ 39 , while the marines went from 43 to 58 and the navy went from 65 to 68 . the air force dipped from 63 to 60 .
" our numbers are not moving in the right direction , " said elizabeth van win@@ kle , director of the pentagon 's office of force resili@@ ency . she said that most of the military rates are comparable to civilians , but added , " that 's hardly comforting . "
military and defense leaders expressed dis@@ may and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force , train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it . van win@@ kle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication . she said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms , but that some states or bases have their own restrictions .
she and karen or@@ vis , director of the suicide prevention office , said recognizing service members who may be struggling or at risk of taking their own lives is very difficult , and that sometimes suicide is a sudden , impulsive decision with little warning . they said it 's difficult to identify reasons for suicide because there are so many stresses that could contribute .
they also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help , because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clear@@ ances . and military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived road@@ blocks .
" just as we talk about physical fitness , mark@@ s@@ manship , training and education , marines must also be comfortable discussing life 's struggles , mental well@@ ness and suicide , " said gen@@ . david berger , comman@@ dant of the marine corps . " we must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal , important decisions marines and sailors make . "
this year for the first time , the pentagon included statistics for su@@ icides by military spouses and depen@@ dents . van win@@ kle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017 , but officials are working to get better at collecting family data .
according to the report , there were 18@@ 6 families that had su@@ icides - 123 were spouses and 63 were depen@@ dents between the ages of 12 and 23 .
the vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40 , while 70 percent of the dependent su@@ icides were males . about half of the depen@@ dents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and , for those younger than that , most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17 .

this model 's runway stom@@ p has eclip@@ sed all else at paris fashion week
as lady g@@ aga once sang in her 2008 hit " bad romance " : " walk , walk , fashion , baby . "
one model took those words to heart and " murdered " the runway , according to one editor , while closing ma@@ ison mar@@ gi@@ ela 's spring 2020 collection by john g@@ alli@@ ano at paris fashion week on wednesday .
model leon dame , 20 , stru@@ tted down the cat@@ walk like no one has stru@@ tted before , power@@ fully putting one foot in front of the other and stom@@ ping down the runway , while keeping an intense , ste@@ ely glare intact .
his walk , paired with his bel@@ ted top , white shorts , k@@ nee@@ -@@ high boots and ca@@ det hat , quickly took the internet by storm . in one video of his walk , it appears he even got a smile out of vogue edit@@ or@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ chief anna win@@ tour as he passed by her .
many praised the young german model , who has appeared in campaigns for ji@@ l san@@ der , f@@ ay and solid hom@@ me , for his distinctive sw@@ ag@@ ger .
actor and " real housewives of beverly hills " star lisa rin@@ na described leon as her " spirit animal , " and fashion designer and singer ri@@ hanna followed him on instagram .

geom@@ agnetic disturbances are expected from september 27 to september 29 , according to the us national atmospheric and oceanic research agency 's space weather forecast center . moderate geom@@ agnetic storm ( g@@ 2 ) is possible due to high@@ -@@ speed solar wind
the russian laboratory for solar activity research at the le@@ be@@ dev institute predicts that the disturbance will start in the evening of september 27 , and cul@@ min@@ ate in the next day from morning until noon . the planetary index can jump to 5 k@@ p level .
geom@@ agnetic storms can affect people with problems in the cardiovascular system . doctors warn that some people may develop heart cra@@ mps , dizziness , headache and lack of concentration . magnetic disturbances often affect people with mental disorders as well .
in case of more severe disturbances , there are also fluctuations in the electricity grid . satellites providing navigation information are also vulnerable .

sony , disney back to work on third sp@@ id@@ er@@ -@@ man film
looks like there will be a hom@@ ec@@ oming of sorts for sp@@ id@@ er@@ -@@ man , now that disney and sony have settled their differences .
the two studios announced on friday that they will collab@@ orate on a third sp@@ id@@ er@@ -@@ man film starring tom holland .
the as yet unti@@ tled film will be released on july 16 , 2021 , and be produced by the disne@@ y@@ -@@ owned marvel studios and its president , kevin fei@@ ge , according to a press release sent by both studios .
amy pas@@ cal will also produce through pas@@ cal pictures , as she has on the first two hol@@ land@@ -@@ led films , the release said .
" i am thrilled that sp@@ ide@@ y 's journey in the mc@@ u will continue , and i and all of us at marvel studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it , " fei@@ ge said in the release . " sp@@ id@@ er@@ -@@ man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe . "
the agreement also allows sp@@ ide@@ y to appear in a future marvel studios film .
fei@@ ge acknowledged the collaboration makes the web@@ sl@@ inger unique among super@@ heroes .
" [ sp@@ id@@ er@@ -@@ man ] happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross c@@ ine@@ matic univers@@ es , so as sony continues to develop their own sp@@ ide@@ y@@ -@@ verse you never know what surprises the future might hold , " he said .
the end to the sp@@ ide@@ y stan@@ doff came more than a month after it was reported the two studios were unable to reach terms on a deal for a sequel to their previous films , " hom@@ ec@@ oming " and " far from home . "
the sticking point was that disney ― which owns the character ― reportedly wanted a co@@ -@@ financing stake in future films with sony , which has the film rights thanks to deals set up before the mouse bought marvel in 2009 .
the hollywood reporter notes both sides had good reason to come together . " far from home " is sony 's biggest box office hit ever , while marvel gets to maximize merchandis@@ ing and keep creative control .
one person who was happy the imp@@ asse has ended was holland himself , who expressed his joy on instagram .
eu , british negoti@@ ators work toward brexit deal in belgium
the european union 's chief brexit negoti@@ ator began talks with british officials in belgium friday to work toward an agreement , with about a month remaining before the departure deadline .
mi@@ chel bar@@ nier met with brexit secretary stephen bar@@ clay in brussels , who was adam@@ ant the irish " back@@ stop " be stripped from any deal . the back@@ stop , effectively an assurance of a soft border between ireland and northern ireland after britain leaves , has been perhaps the chief obstacle in negotiations .
while bar@@ clay said britain is committed to finding a deal , he said there isn 't much time left .
" i think there is still a long way to go . i think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations , " he said .
the deadline to leave the eu is oc@@ t@@ . 31 , but a new british law prevents prime minister boris johnson from completing the withdrawal without a trade agreement , or parliament 's approval to leave without one by oc@@ t@@ . 19 .
last week , eu negoti@@ ators said they are open to an alternative to the back@@ stop -@@ - but irish deputy simon coven@@ ey said friday london hasn 't yet submitted a " serious " proposal .
" until there is a serious proposal , which can be the basis of negotiations , then the gaps which are wide at the moment will remain , " he said .
he added that " time is running out " and " the on@@ us is on the british prime minister and his team " to put serious proposals on the table .
johnson 's office said friday there are still " significant obstacles " to a deal .
" from an irish perspective , we of course think that an extension is prefer@@ able to a no@@ -@@ deal , " coven@@ ey said . " but i think there would have to be good reason behind that to ask for an extension . "
eu president je@@ an@@ -@@ claude junc@@ ker said he and bar@@ nier are doing everything they can for a deal and if they fail , it 's britain 's fault .
irish prime minister leo var@@ ad@@ kar said he 's not optimistic about a deal , but urged british leaders to present a plan at a brexit summit on oc@@ t@@ . 17 .
" the withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty , " he said . " it 's not the kind of thing that can be amended or cob@@ bled together late at night . "
scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star
scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light@@ -@@ years away from earth that de@@ fies current understanding about planet formation , with a large ju@@ p@@ iter@@ -@@ like planet orbiting a di@@ minu@@ tive star known as a red dwarf .
an artistic impression of the gas giant planet g@@ j 35@@ 12@@ b orbiting its red dwarf host star , released on september 26 , 2019 .
stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them . but in this case , the star and the planet are not much different in size , the researchers said on thursday .
the star , called g@@ j 35@@ 12 , is about 12 % the size of our sun , while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of jupiter , our solar system 's largest planet .
" yes , an absolute surprise , " said astro@@ physicist juan carlos mor@@ ales of the institute of space studies of catal@@ onia at the institute of space sciences in spain , who led the research published in the journal science .
" the discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low@@ -@@ mass stars typically host small planets , similar to earth or small nep@@ tun@@ es . in this case , we have found a gas giant planet similar to jupiter around a very small star , " mor@@ ales added .
the planet , which like jupiter is composed mainly of gas , was discovered using a telescope at the cal@@ ar alto observatory in spain . it travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 20@@ 4 days .
red dwar@@ fs are small , with relatively low surface temperatures . g@@ j 35@@ 12 is not only much smaller than our sun , it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet , being only about 35 % bigger than jupiter .
" they emit less energy , so they are fa@@ inter than the sun , and their surface temperature is rather cool , below 3@@ 800 ( degrees ) kel@@ vin ( 6,@@ 380 degrees fahrenheit / 3,@@ 5@@ 27 celsius ) approximately . this is why the have a reddish color , " mor@@ ales said .
there is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star , while a third planet might have been ejec@@ ted from the star system in the past , explaining the elliptical orbit of the ju@@ p@@ iter@@ -@@ like planet , mor@@ ales said .
planets are born from the same disk of inter@@ stellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit . under the leading model for planetary formation , called the " core ac@@ cre@@ tion " model , an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas .
a competing model , called the gravitational instability model , may explain this unusual system .
" in this case , the proto@@ planetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold , " mor@@ ales said . " this makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear . these clum@@ ps can grow until they collapse , forming a planet . "
school stri@@ kers around the world march to demand action on climate
children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change friday , in their first major action since the issue topped world leader 's agenda at the united nations this week .
the fri@@ days for future movement that began as a lone demonstration by swedish teen gre@@ ta th@@ un@@ berg@@ just over a year ago has mush@@ room@@ ed , with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like new yor@@ k@@ and attracting attention in developing nations across africa .
some of the first protests began in new zealand , where th@@ un@@ berg said@@ organizers estimated 17@@ 0,000 people marched across the country . there were also mar@@ ches in cities in italy , finland , nigeria , austria and india , among other countries .
friday 's protest followed a week of climate talks at the united nations in new york , which included a sca@@ thing speech by th@@ un@@ berg@@ to world leaders repri@@ man@@ ding them for inaction .
" you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words , " she said on tuesday . " the eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us , i say we will never forgive you . "
citing a u.@@ n@@ .@@ -@@ backed repor@@ tre@@ leased last year , demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees , which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet .
th@@ un@@ berg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walk@@ outs until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change .
in nigeria 's capital abu@@ ja , ol@@ ad@@ os@@ u aden@@ ike marked her 46@@ th consecutive strike on friday . the activist posted images on twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying banners with messages , " climate change is real " and " we don 't have time . "
in la@@ us@@ anne , switzerland , where hundreds of climate strike organizers ga@@ there@@ din august planning for this week 's events , thousands of people marched through the city , according to local reports .
thousands more were expected to take to the streets of hel@@ sin@@ ki , finland , where local media reported@@ that the city 's school would allow students to participate .
th@@ un@@ berg , who remains in north america following her visit to the u.@@ n@@ . , was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in montreal , canada .
serena williams fined $ 10,000 for allegedly damaging wim@@ ble@@ don court
serena williams , tennis legend and seven@@ -@@ time wim@@ ble@@ don champion , is being fined $ 10,000 for allegedly damaging the london practice courts with her r@@ acqu@@ et .
the all england club , which hosts the wim@@ ble@@ don tournament , handed the fine to williams after she reportedly caused damage during a practice round on the outside courts on june 30 , according to the associated press and cnn .
the 37@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old tennis star appeared to shru@@ g off the fine while speaking to reporters after winning the quarter@@ final round against alison ris@@ ke on tuesday .
" i haven 't really thought about it , to be honest , " she said when asked about the fine . " i just threw my r@@ acqu@@ et . i got fined . "
williams said she didn 't know how that could 've caused damage .
" i mean , i guess if you could tell me , i would appreciate it , " she told reporters . " i mean , i have always been an av@@ enger in my heart . maybe i 'm super strong . i don 't know . "
williams is after her eighth wim@@ ble@@ don title , which would be her 24@@ th grand slam victory . she is advancing to the singles semi@@ finals on thursday against czech player bar@@ bor@@ a str@@ ý@@ co@@ v@@ á .
williams was also fined a total of $ 17@@ ,000 last year after she defended herself against an um@@ p@@ ire at the u.s. open who accused her of illegally communicating with her coach during a match .
during that incident , the um@@ p@@ ire issued three code violations to williams : one for receiving illegal coaching , a second for breaking her tennis racket in frustration and a third after she confronted the um@@ p@@ ire and called him a " thief . "
many of williams " fans claimed that the um@@ p@@ ire was un@@ necessarily harsh in his response to her , especially considering male players " mel@@ t@@ downs throughout the history of the sport .
" do you know how many other men do things that are much worse than that ? " williams told u.s. open officials who entered the court during the match after her confrontation with the um@@ p@@ ire .
williams wasn 't the only one who received a fine at this year 's wim@@ ble@@ don , though hers was the most costly .
italian player fab@@ io fog@@ nin@@ i was fined $ 3,000 for saying a " bomb should explode " at the tennis courts after he lost the third round to u.s. player ten@@ n@@ ys sand@@ gre@@ n on saturday .
nick kyr@@ gi@@ os of australia was hit with two fines ― one for $ 3,000 and a second for $ 5,000 ― for un@@ sports@@ man@@ like conduct .

" the band had performed eight songs already but promised to try and return for another show one day in the future . watch the video of how it all un@@ folded on stage .
after playing classic 1982 track emin@@ ence front , dal@@ tre@@ y called it qu@@ it@@ s. he has struggled with vocal issues and apparently is under strict instructions from his surgeon .
the british star told the crowd he couldn 't go on with the show : " if i carry on trying to do what i 'm doing for you , i 'm going to damage myself . i think i should quit while i 'm ahead ... last time , i ended up in hospital for a month and i 'm not going there again . sorry . "
pete town@@ sh@@ end explained what was going on to the audience : " it sounds like he cannot do any more , i 'm afraid ... "
the band left the stage , originally suggesting they would try to work out the rest of the set without roger .
when he returned , town@@ send said : " i 'm really , really sorry . roger cannot actually speak now .
" apparently , before the show , he saw a doctor , and you know , he 's been singing so f * * * ing great through this tour . i don 't know what the f * * * is going on . he has been on top of his game .
" i 'm really sorry this has happened to you guys tonight ... i don 't think there is much point trying to put anything together that makes any sense because this is roger 's show and he 's not in good shape . "
the crowd was completely supportive , cheering the 7@@ 4@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old as he explained what had happened and how the band hoped to return to honour their commitment to the show .
town@@ send said ; " we will publish a date for our return as soon as we can . let me explain one thing ... we only do one day on , one day off . this is because roger 's vocal surgeon insists he has a day off ...

sev@@ ent@@ y@@ -@@ four years ago , two nuclear bombs were detonated over hiroshima and nag@@ as@@ aki , killing tens of thousands of people .
since then , wherever conflict between major powers rises , so does the threat of a nuclear war .
various treaties have attempted to suppress that threat , yet today there are nearly 14@@ ,000 nuclear weapons based around the world .
thursday marks the international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons , but it 's a goal that looks increasingly less likely .
so , is there the political will to abolish these weapons ?

me@@ ghan mar@@ kle is determined to ' fulfil her heart 's desires ' and not let her own needs ' fade away ' now she 's a member of the royal family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls .
the duchess of sus@@ sex , 38 , reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at wood@@ stock exchange in cape town earlier this week during her tour of south africa with husband prince harry .
wood@@ stock exchange , the uk@@ -@@ sa tech hub , focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs , particularly women , to acquire skills , resources and support .
the ladies who launch meeting saw the former actress , 38 , meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology , conservation and fashion and praise them for ' em@@ powering the next generation ' of creative minds .
during a conversation with the female tech founders me@@ ghan , who has campaig@@ ned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls , said she hopes to do the same for young men .
mother@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ two na@@ adi@@ ya mo@@ osa@@ je@@ e , a south african engineer , social entrepreneur and co@@ -@@ founder of women in engineering , revealed : ' we acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well , ' people reports .
'@@ we both have sons , and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons , but generally in public too . '
she added that having me@@ ghan present ' didn 't feel hierarchical ' , as it was ' women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have , as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies ' .
mat@@ si mo@@ dis@@ e , founder of skills training company si@@ mo@@ dis@@ a , said me@@ ghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the fold .
'@@ she talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can 't just fade away now that you 're a duchess , ' mo@@ dis@@ e recalled .
'@@ that you have to be true to who you are . '
she said the duchess pushed them to pl@@ ough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward , knowing they are doing it for others who will follow .
'@@ she wasn 't referring to being a royal , but life in general when you have challenges , ' mo@@ dis@@ e added , admitting she felt a bit ' a@@ we@@ struck ' by me@@ ghan .
'@@ she radi@@ ates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace , ' mo@@ dis@@ e said .
'@@ a lot of us have done amazing things as founders , but meeting a royal is quite daunting . she made it easy . she is an easy@@ -@@ going royal . '
me@@ ghan also revealed she 's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother , admitting she finds ju@@ ggling being a royal and looking after baby archi@@ e ' a lot ' but ' all so exciting ' .
speaking to mother@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ two lar@@ a ro@@ smar@@ in , ceo of cape innovation and technology , me@@ ghan said : ' we 're only five months in right now . being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby , my goodness it 's a lot , but it 's all so exciting .
'@@ there are days when it 's a lot to ju@@ ggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say " ah@@ -@@ ha , " and it 's so rewarding . '
me@@ ghan then went to the city 's mother@@ s@@ 2@@ mothers organisation , which trains and employs women with hiv .
she took along some of archi@@ e 's baby clothes , including a ones@@ ie saying ' the future ' and his inv@@ ic@@ tus baby@@ gro which he no longer fits , alongside donations from her friends with children .
parents of 5@@ -@@ mon@@ th@@ -@@ old stuffed in suitcase and tossed in dum@@ p@@ ster get 6 years in prison
the parents of a 5 ½ -@@ mon@@ th@@ -@@ old boy whose body was thrown in a dum@@ p@@ ster were sentenced to six years in prison after ple@@ ading no contest thursday to charges in the baby 's death .
adam man@@ son , 34 , and ki@@ ana williams , 32 , each pleaded no contest to one felony count of child abuse resulting in death and admitted to a special alleg@@ ation that they caused the death of their son , jac@@ sun man@@ son , the los angeles county district attorney announced .
man@@ son and williams had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges .
the two had been doing drugs in a south l@@ .@@ a. motel on new year 's eve when they found the baby dead , prosecutors said . they placed his body in a suitcase and tossed it in a trash bin near the bal@@ d@@ win hills c@@ ren@@ shaw plaza , prosecutors said .
in late april , weeks after searching through the el so@@ bran@@ te landfill in corona , authorities called off the search . the child 's body was never found .
police said in a statement at the time that they made the decision to end the search for jac@@ sun with a " heavy heart , " but noted they couldn 't pin@@ point a location in the landfill " to a point that would make continuing the search reasonable . "
uk 's medical drug supply still uncertain in no@@ -@@ deal brexit
britain 's government watch@@ dog says there is still a " significant amount " of work to do to ensure the country has an adequate supply of medical drugs in case of a no@@ -@@ deal brexit .
in a report issued friday , britain 's national audit office said additional shipping capacity chartered by the u.@@ k@@ . for sending goods across the english channel might not be operational until the end of november - one month after the oc@@ t@@ . 31 deadline for britain to leave the european union . of the more than 12,@@ 300 medicines licensed in the u.@@ k@@ . , about 7,000 arrive from or via the eu , mostly across the channel .
according to the british government 's " reasonable wor@@ st@@ -@@ case " scenario , the flow of goods could be cut by half on day one of a no@@ -@@ deal brexit and could take a year to recover . it said time was " extremely limited " if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of october .
the report also said there was " incomplete information " about the levels of medicine stock@@ piling but that levels were increasingly daily . as of sept . 20 , suppliers reported that 72 % of medicines had a six@@ -@@ week stock@@ pile .
" in the event of a no@@ -@@ deal exit , the department ( of health ) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hu@@ gely demanding task , " the watch@@ dog wrote .
meg h@@ illi@@ er , who chairs a committee over@@ seeing the audit office , called the findings " deeply concerning . " she said she had seen " countless examples " of the british government missing dead@@ lines , but that this one was particularly striking .
" if the government gets this wrong , it could have the gra@@ vest of consequences , " she said .
dr. richard tor@@ bet@@ t of the association of the british pharmaceutical industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for brexit , " some things are outside of their control . "
he said more details were needed on how companies might access government@@ -@@ planned freight capacity if britain sees a no@@ -@@ deal departure from the eu .
" securing a ( brexit ) deal remains the best way to protect patients , " he said .
cleveland police branded ' failing ' in all areas by inspectors
scand@@ al@@ -@@ hit cleveland police has become the first force to be branded " failing " in all areas by inspectors .
it has been rated inadequate overall and in three key areas by her majesty 's inspec@@ tor@@ ate of con@@ stab@@ ul@@ ary and fire and rescue services ( h@@ mic@@ fr@@ s ) , which scru@@ tin@@ ised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe , operate efficiently , as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce .
the findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures , where the chief con@@ stable and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure " critical improvements " are made .
the home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made .
a string of scandals has plagued the force , covering har@@ tle@@ pool , red@@ car and cleveland , stock@@ ton and midd@@ les@@ br@@ ough in the north east of england .
it has seen six chief con@@ stab@@ les in almost as many years .
former chief con@@ stable sean price was s@@ acked for gross misconduct in 2012 ; seven officers were under investigation after journalists " phones were un@@ law@@ fully monitored , and there have been long@@ -@@ standing claims of racism within the ranks .
work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of con@@ stab@@ ul@@ ary as being about as " inefficient as you can possibly imagine , " with officers having to share laptops and body@@ worn cameras .
hm inspector of con@@ stab@@ ul@@ ary phil gor@@ m@@ ley said it was a " failing force " where there had been " significant " deterioration in the last two years .
tees valley mayor ben hou@@ chen said the report described the " worst findings ever into any police force in the country " which was " finally the official validation " that the force is " broken " and said the home office needed to intervene now .
he added : " it 's no longer in dispute . it is a fact described in black and white in this report .
" the findings are some of the most distres@@ sing and shocking i have ever read . "
cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently inspected by h@@ mic@@ fr@@ s inspectors , and the only one rated inadequate in all areas .
gor@@ m@@ ley added : " the force doesn 't appropriately priori@@ tise crime prevention . there is a lack of strategic direction , and the force doesn 't allocate enough resources to prevention work ... it is failing to respond appropriately to vulnerable people , including children . it is missing opportunities to safeguard them and exposing them to risk . "
he said senior leaders were not consistently demonstrating " ethical behaviour , " and the " inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force . "
he added : " it doesn 't consistently treat its workforce with fairness and respect and it doesn 't effectively communicate with or engage its workforce ; its processes aren 't perceived to be fair and it doesn 't understand its workforce well enough to support them . "
despite the findings , the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tack@@ les serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investigates crimes .
the force 's police and crime commissioner barry cop@@ ping@@ er said : " i am deeply concerned at the worrying contents of this report .
" the force 's recent performance is simply not good enough . "
he said he had received as@@ sur@@ ances from the current chief con@@ stable richard lewis that " swift action " was taken as soon as he became aware of the fail@@ ings .
cop@@ ping@@ er has been ordered by the home office to respond to the report within 56 days .
lewis said the report would act " as a line in the sand " for the force , adding : " improvements have already been made and i take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed . in the five months i 've been here i have met some exceptional police officers and staff , at all levels , and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of frontline officers . "
if drastic improvements are not made quickly enough , the government could step in , as it can when prisons are failing .
but so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces , inspectors said .
kit mal@@ thouse , minister for crime , polic@@ ing and fire , said he welcomed the chief con@@ stable 's " swift action to address these fail@@ ings and will be monitoring the position closely , " adding : " transparency and accountability are vital for public trust in polic@@ ing .
im@@ manuel christian school : six@@ th@@ -@@ grade boys accused of p@@ inning down black girl and cutting off her dread@@ locks in virginia
a black middle school student from virginia is accusing three white boys of p@@ inning her down and cutting off her dread@@ locks . the incident took place at im@@ manuel christian school - where vice president mike pence 's wife , karen pence , is a teacher .
am@@ ari allen , a 12@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old student at the private k@@ -@@ 12 christian school , said the boys called her dread@@ locks " ugly " and " nap@@ py " before cutting them off on the playground during recess .
" they kept laughing and calling me names , " am@@ ari told cbs affili@@ ate wus@@ a@@ -@@ tv , tearing up . " they called me ' ugly , ' said , ' i shouldn 't have been born . ' they called me ' an atten@@ tion@@ -@@ seeker . ' "
according to w@@ usa , one of the boys allegedly covered am@@ ari 's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dread@@ locks .
am@@ ari didn 't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed .
" they ran off laughing , and i was just sitting there , " am@@ ari said .
the alleged incident occurred on monday , but the shy pre@@ teen said she didn 't tell her family about it until wednesday , after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different . she feared retaliation if she confessed the truth , she said .
" it 's very painful , " said cyn@@ thia allen , am@@ ari 's grandmother . " i want to see them dismissed from the school . i want to see something done . "
allen 's family pays nearly $ 12,000 per year for am@@ ari to attend the school , which made headlines earlier this year after karen pence took an art teaching job at the fam@@ ously anti@@ -@@ l@@ g@@ b@@ t@@ q institution .
" we take seriously the emotional and physical well@@ -@@ being of all our students , and have a z@@ ero@@ -@@ tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse , " im@@ manuel christian school said in a statement . " we are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made , and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can . we have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation , and further inquiries should be directed to the fair@@ fax county police . "
while the school has a z@@ ero@@ -@@ tolerance policy for bullying , am@@ ari said the boys had previously tor@@ mented her . she said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past .
am@@ ari 's family met with school officials thursday , and the investigation is ongoing .
iran releases british oil tanker sten@@ a imper@@ o
iran released a british@@ -@@ flag@@ ged oil tanker on friday , two months after it captured the vessel for allegedly entering its waters in violation of international law .
iranian ports and maritime administration confirmed that the vessel , sten@@ a imper@@ o , left band@@ ar abbas port at 9 a.@@ m. , the state@@ -@@ run ir@@ na reported .
eri@@ k han@@ ell , president and ceo of sten@@ a bulk , the operator of the ship , also confirmed the ship 's release .
" sten@@ a bulk and northern marine management confirm the sten@@ a imper@@ o and its crew have been released , " he said via twitter .
the ship was captured by the iranian revolutionary guard corps on july 19 for having violated international maritime law when it allegedly ve@@ ered into iranian waters in the strait of hor@@ mu@@ z .
the vessel 's seizure , however , was widely seen as retali@@ atory for british forces capturing a tanker off gi@@ br@@ altar on suspicion of transporting persian oil to syria in violation of international sanctions . the ship was released in mid@@ -@@ august despite the trump administration making a last@@ -@@ ditch attempt to length its detention .
the sten@@ a imper@@ o was officially given permission to leave on monday but was kept in port until a probe into the ship 's conduct completed , the new york times reported .
" the vessel has left the port of band@@ ar abbas and is trans@@ iting to dubai for the crew to dis@@ embark and receive medical checks and de@@ briefing , " han@@ ell said . " the families of crew members have been informed and the company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seaf@@ arers at the earliest possible opportunity . "
the ship became victim to escalating tensions near the persian gulf where both the united states and iran shot down the other 's drone and at least two tan@@ kers were sabo@@ t@@ aged by explosives , which the trump administration has blamed iran for .
the trump administration most recently blamed iran for drone attacks on saudi arabian oil facilities , which tehran denies having any involvement with .

uganda : government launches oral hiv self@@ -@@ test kit
ministry of health has launched an oral hiv self@@ -@@ test kit aimed at em@@ powering citizens , especially men to carry out hiv testing .
the initiative is aimed at reducing new hiv / aids infections by 2020 .
the oral hiv test kit dubbed , or@@ a@@ quick hiv self@@ -@@ test , a product of or@@ as@@ ure technologies , targets young people aged 18 to 24 years , men and priority populations such as sex workers .
" currently we are targeting young people 18 to 24 years . for the young people that 's the age bracket we are looking at but of course any one above 18 and it 's because we do not have evidence of children by the constitution but as more evidence un@@ folds we are going to get there . for the men , we give the kit to the mother and they take it to the partner , key and priority populations such sex workers , " mr ge@@ off@@ rey tas@@ i , the technical offic@@ er@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ charge of hiv testing services , said yesterday .
easy use
initially , the self@@ -@@ test kits available involve the use of blood to detect the hiv , however , with oral hiv self@@ -@@ test kit , oral fluids are involved .
the test works by detecting antibodies , the body 's natural defenders against infection . if one is infected with hiv , these antibodies will be present in your blood and also in the sali@@ via . the test will detect the antibodies in the mouth .
data by the uganda aids commission ( u@@ ac ) shows that uganda is registering 1,000 new hiv / aids infections and 500 deaths from the viral disease per week , translating into 5@@ 3,000 new infections and 2@@ 3,000 deaths annually .
dr diana at@@ wine , the permanent secretary in the ministry of health , said this is timely and will enhance the fight against hiv / aids .
she , however , urged the men to take hiv testing as an important issue .
she added that there is still effort to reach the 14 per cent of the people , who are living with hiv but do not know their hiv status .
" currently , 86 per cent people living with hiv know their status ; that means it leave us with 14 per cent of those living with hiv and do not know their status . so how do we now uti@@ lis@@ e that additional innovation . really for me this is it ... how do we now move from this kit and create demand , especially for that 14 per cent that are sick and they need care and they are not getting care , " dr at@@ wine said .
however , health officials warn one should not eat or drink within 15 minutes before starting the test .
mr tas@@ i said studies conducted showed no suicide cases and the ministry is confident that the potential of harm can be avoided because the test is voluntary .
dr at@@ wine said apart from graphics and videos provided to educate the users , there should be toll free numbers always available to offer coun@@ selling in both government and private facilities , including all pharmacies .
research . according to the research , or@@ a@@ quick hiv self@@ -@@ test detected more than 99 per cent of people , who were infected with hiv and people , who were not infected with hiv .
athletes feeling the heat at qatar world championships
some competitors at the world athletics championships that began on friday have already encountered their most challenging opponent : the s@@ wel@@ tering q@@ at@@ ari heat .
with its suffoc@@ ating humidity and daytime temperatures hovering around 38 degrees celsius , doha weather has been widely discussed among athletes and athletics officials and seen as a cause for concern in some events .
those competing on the road in the marathon and walking races will begin their events in the middle of the night to minimize the heat 's harmful effects .
although the heat is less of a threat to the athletes competing inside the khal@@ ifa international stadium , where temperatures are kept at around 21 degrees with the help of a cooling system , they have still had to adjust their training because they practise at an outdoor facility .
" we are from a hot climate as well , but nothing to compare with this , " ba@@ ha@@ mian coach ronald car@@ tw@@ right told reuters .
" here you walk outside and it 's like somebody put a heater on you . i guess that is why they are doing it at night . "
athletics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race wal@@ kers .
the ia@@ af , the global governing body of athletics , said the women 's marathon , scheduled to start at midnight on friday , would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees .
it said its medical delegate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monitored all day and reported to the teams " to ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk . "
track athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances , but conce@@ ded that practices have been especially dra@@ ining .
" at practice i 'm glowing because i 'm sweating because it 's so humid , " said ra@@ i benjamin , who compe@@ tes in the 4@@ 00@@ m hur@@ dles .
" it 's like i got out of the shower . but i don 't think it will be that bad because of the cooling system . "
shot pu@@ tter ryan cr@@ ous@@ er , the 2016 olympic champion , said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees celsius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the si@@ zzling heat and high humidity .
" the shot is far below the dew point , the instant you take it out , it 's just soaking wet and it 's dripping water , " the american said . " it 's worse than if it was pouring down rain ... we 've been fighting this a little bit . "
european pole vault champion arm@@ and du@@ plan@@ tis , who trains in the heat of the southern u.s. state of louisiana , said the humidity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moisture to the chalk on his hands " makes for a really nice grip . "
but other pole va@@ ul@@ ters who spray a sticky grip enh@@ ancer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their poles in the humidity , he said .
" for people who use sticky spray , i can see it being a problem because it can get a little sli@@ my and goo@@ ey , " du@@ plan@@ tis said .
fears of security breach at major prison as lock@@ smith is arrested
a prison lock@@ smith has been arrested amid fears keys to a jail 's cells have been copied resulting in taxpayers footing a £ 500,000 bill to replace all its locks .
h@@ mp wand@@ s@@ worth called in police amid fears that dupl@@ ic@@ ates had been sold to some of its 1,@@ 400 inmates .
the suspected security breach will result in 3,000 locks replaced , potentially to cell , internal and outer doors .
police arrested a 40@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old man at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office on september 13 . the man , from south west london , was working for the government facility services ltd , which maintains 52 j@@ ails across the south of the country .
the police investigation has raised concerns that im@@ prints of some of the keys may have been taken in clay before actual copies were produced .
however , prison bosses stressed that they had not found any evidence that inmates had obtained any keys .
wand@@ s@@ worth prison is a category b jail in south west london which can house up to 1,@@ 6@@ 28 prisoners , making it one of the largest prisons in western europe . the jail , built in 18@@ 51 , holds convicted male criminals and those on rem@@ and awaiting trial .
a prison service spokeswoman said : " h@@ mp wand@@ s@@ worth has increased security at the gate and is operating extra identity checks as a result of a security incident . it would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing . "
house chair@@ men warn trump to stop attacking whist@@ le@@ blower
" the president 's comments today constitute re@@ prehen@@ sible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruc@@ t congress ' impeachment inquiry . we condemn the president 's attacks , and we invite our republican counterparts to do the same because congress must do all it can to protect this whist@@ le@@ blower , and all whist@@ le@@ blow@@ ers , " they said . " threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whist@@ le@@ blower process , with grave consequences for our democracy and national security . "

" no officials with knowledge relevant to the committees ' investigation , including knowledge of the subject of the whist@@ le@@ blower complaint , may be subject to any intimidation , re@@ pris@@ al , or threat of re@@ pris@@ al , and all witnesses must be made available for congressional testimony , " they added .
the statement on thursday comes amid@@ st an explosive week in washington rooted in a whist@@ le@@ blower complaint alleg@@ ing that trump abused his official powers " to sol@@ icit interference " from ukrainian president vol@@ o@@ dy@@ my@@ r z@@ el@@ en@@ sky in the upcoming 2020 election , and the white house took steps to cover it up . a transcript of july phone conversation released by the white house on wednesday shows trump repeatedly pushed z@@ el@@ en@@ sky to investigate former vice president joe biden and his son , hunter .
there is no evidence of wrong@@ doing by either joe or hunter biden .
even before the whist@@ le@@ blower complaint was made available to lawmakers , house speaker nancy pel@@ osi on tuesday declared trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the president .

obama , who knows first@@ -@@ hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight , dol@@ ed out some advice to the duchess in an interview with good housekeeping .
" the pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot , " she said . " so my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don 't be in a hurry to do anything . "
she continued :
i spent the first few months in the white house mainly worrying about my daughters , making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before i launched into any more ambitious work . i think it 's okay - it 's good , even - to do that .

recent deals , however , suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more selective about the los@@ s@@ -@@ making companies they are willing to back .
pel@@ o@@ ton reported rapid top@@ -@@ line growth of 110 % during the fiscal year that ended june 30 . but the company also showed negative operating leverage , with operating expenses surging 14@@ 7 % over the prior year .
los@@ s@@ -@@ making te@@ eth@@ -@@ alignment company smil@@ e@@ direc@@ t@@ club sd@@ c@@ .@@ o earlier this month became the first u.s. ipo in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day , according to research firm renaissance capital .
the average ipo return in 2019 is now about 9 % , down from more than 30 % at the end of june and more than 18 % about two weeks ago .
in the united states , much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fru@@ ition - the planned ipo of we@@ work parent we company .
having aimed to launch its ipo earlier in september , the company postponed plans to list until later in 2019 , before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timetable to go public .
endeavor group holdings ( e@@ dr@@ .@@ n ) , an entertainment and talent agency company backed by hollywood power broker ari e@@ manuel with a track record of losses , made a last@@ -@@ minute decision to abandon its ipo due to the tough market conditions . taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ri@@ de@@ -@@ ha@@ iling companies uber technologies ( u@@ ber@@ .@@ n ) and ly@@ ft inc ( ly@@ ft@@ .@@ o ) , which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable , investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses . " it will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say , " these were isolated and not comparable , " or say " we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy , " " said david eth@@ ridge , u.s. ipo services leader at audit firm pw@@ c . the market was more recep@@ tive to les@@ ser@@ -@@ known names such as cyber security company ping identity ping@@ .@@ n and cloud monitoring company dat@@ ado@@ g inc d@@ dog@@ .@@ o@@ . both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers .
jonathan van ness just hung out with nancy pel@@ osi and they 've got a plan
" que@@ er eye " star jonathan van ness stru@@ tted his stuff on capitol hill on thursday , joining forces with house speaker nancy pel@@ osi ( d@@ -@@ cal@@ if . ) to discuss the equality act .
the equality act would extend non@@ discrimination protec@@ tions to l@@ g@@ b@@ t@@ q individuals in credit , education , employment , housing , federal financial assistance , jury service and public accommo@@ dations .
the bill would amend the civil rights act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes .
van ness , who recently publicly came out as hiv positive , first shared a video of himself cat@@ -@@ walking in the capitol , explaining in his caption that he 'd met with the house speaker to talk equality act , living with hiv and access to prep ( an hiv preven@@ tative medication ) :
he then shared a longer post pic@@ turing the two of them arm in arm , urging his followers to stand up to senate majority leader mitch mc@@ conn@@ ell ( r@@ -@@ ky . ) and apply pressure to go@@ p senators to bring the equality act up for a senate vote :
pel@@ osi introduced the equality act on march 13 . the house passed the legislation in may . it has not yet been brought to the senate floor .
in august , the trump administration asked the supreme court to essentially leg@@ alize anti@@ -@@ gay discrimination in the workplace , arguing in an am@@ icus brief that the federal laws on employer discrimination in the civil rights act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being fired based on their sexual orientation .
pel@@ osi met earlier this year with van ness and three of his " que@@ er eye " co@@ -@@ stars as well as rep@@ . alexand@@ ria oc@@ asi@@ o@@ -@@ cor@@ te@@ z ( d@@ -@@ n@@ .@@ y@@ . ) , to talk policy and promote the bill .
on thursday , pel@@ osi shared her own image of herself and van ness warmly holding hands on a balcony , thanking him for bringing his voice to the fight :
david atten@@ borough working on new documentary about animals and colour
david atten@@ borough is 9@@ 3@@ -@@ years@@ -@@ old but the iconic nature gur@@ u is not slowing down just yet .
no , after the success of his ground@@ breaking netflix documentary our planet , the much loved star is set to return with another series : life in colour .
this time , the father@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high@@ -@@ tech cameras that were built especially for the programme .
the bbc have revealed that the star aims to show " a world of colour normally invisible to human eyes " - and it sounds truly fascinating .
however , despite fans being eager for the upcoming release , it seems we all need to sit tight as it won 't be dropping on our screens until 2021 .
but we 're sure it 'll be worth the wait .
earlier this month , david was presented with the tv choice lifetime achievement award , at the prestigious ceremony in london .
the national treasure has enter@@ tained millions over his career , which has so far span@@ ned 60 years .
when collecting his gong , the reporter enth@@ used : " indeed . what i do isn 't always entertaining , and sometimes people hear things they don 't like !
" but this is an honour and a great pleasure . "
tv choice said of the winner : " still working , learning and making programmes sir david atten@@ borough isn 't just a british hero , he 's a global icon . "
this week , david was celebrated once again as a polar research ship was named after him .
the star joined both prince william and kate for the naming ceremony in cam@@ m@@ ell la@@ ird shipyard in bir@@ ken@@ head , mer@@ sey@@ side .
he said : " it 's no news to any of you that the world is facing great , great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today , who will inherit this world .
" great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them .
" that 's what this astonishing ship will be here to do , to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow . "
life in colour is expected to air on bbc two in 2021 , while it 's said netflix will retain global rights .
don 't use my wife 's name to score points , says husband of murdered mp jo cox
the husband of jo cox said his wife 's name must not be used to score political points after jeremy cor@@ by@@ n last night posted footage of the murdered mp to critic@@ ise boris johnson .
the labour leader 's film featured clips of mrs cox and a vi@@ gil held after her death , with the caption : " boris johnson does not care about violence on our streets . "
critics said mr cor@@ by@@ n was using her murder to score " cheap political points " while her husband bren@@ dan cox said the labour leader was " wrong " to inf@@ er hateful language was a " simple party political issue . "
mr cox said : " jeremy is right that the best way to honour jo is to defeat hatred and division . he 's also right the pm has a particular responsibility .
" but he 's wrong to inf@@ er this is a simple party political issue . jo was passi@@ on@@ ately labour but some things must transcen@@ d party politics . "
he also shared a post which said jo cox 's name was " more than a political scoring point " with the caption " this . thank you . " mr cor@@ by@@ n was facing a back@@ lash for his video which opens with him talking about mrs cox 's murder three years ago by a far@@ -@@ right activist in her west yor@@ kshire constituency .
speaking over a mon@@ tage of clips of mrs cox , mr johnson and female mps , mr cor@@ by@@ n said : " this prime minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences . he wants division . clearly , he doesn 't care about the violence on our streets . "
he goes on to critic@@ ise mr johnson and call for a labour government .
mr cor@@ by@@ n added : " many are deeply concerned about the language used by boris johnson , language which is being repeated by the far@@ -@@ right . when this was raised with him by women mps , who themselves face death threats , he arro@@ g@@ antly dismissed them . it was nothing short of dis@@ graceful . " former labour mp john wood@@ cock shared the video and said : " you can really shut up . disgusting . "
meanwhile tory mp and business minister nad@@ him za@@ haw@@ i said : " you are so wrong to use jo cox in this way , when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way . to be kept out of politics .
" if you have an ounce of dec@@ ency jeremy cor@@ by@@ n you would take this video down . " it follows a row over language in parliament this week in which mr johnson said that the " best way " to honour mrs cox was to " get brexit done . " her sister kim lead@@ be@@ ater called for a di@@ alling down of extreme language saying it was " not helpful to jo 's kids . "
she told it@@ v : " for me to come out and say outrageous things about boris johnson - i just don 't think that 's a useful way of moving forward . i can say what i think is right and what i think is wrong but i 'm going to try and do that in a measured manner . "
the daughter of labour mp y@@ ve@@ tte cooper spoke out yesterday to say she constantly fears for her mother 's life because of the way people speak about politicians .
house rebu@@ kes trump on border wall , but he plans veto
the democra@@ tic@@ -@@ controlled house is making a second attempt to over@@ turn president donald trump 's use of emergency powers to raid military base projects such as schools and target ranges to pay for his long@@ -@@ promised border fence .
the 23@@ 6@@ -@@ 17@@ 4 vote sent the legislation to trump , who is sure to veto it just as he killed a similar measure in march .
the senate passed the measure last week with about a dozen veteran republican lawmakers rebu@@ king trump .
friday 's vote was different because it followed the recent release by the administration of a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $ 3.6 billion that will be canceled to pay for the border wall , including numerous projects in go@@ p districts and states .
brazil says oil in spill along northeast beaches not brazilian
brazil 's environmental agency ib@@ ama said on thursday that an analysis of a vast oil spill along the country 's northeastern beaches showed the spilled crude did not orig@@ inate in the country .
ib@@ ama said in a statement that it had been investigating the spill in several beaches in some northeastern states since sept . 2 . local media showed pictures of sea turtles coated in black tar by the sl@@ ick .
the spill spans over 1,500 kilometers ( 9@@ 32 miles ) of brazil 's northeast coast , affecting wildlife and polluting some of the postcard beaches in one of the nation 's top tour@@ istic destinations , such as pra@@ ia do fu@@ tur@@ o , in the state of ce@@ ara , and mar@@ ag@@ og@@ i , in al@@ ago@@ as state .
brazil 's state@@ -@@ controlled oil company petrole@@ o br@@ as@@ ile@@ iro sa said in a statement that it had concluded after a molecular analysis of the oil that the crude spilled was not produced nor sold by the company .
crude oil is tested before export to make sure it compl@@ ies with the standards of the refinery it is being shipped to . crude oil from different fields can be identified according to a series of chemical signatures , including levels of sulfur and nitrogen , acidity and viscosity .
the head of brazil 's oil agency an@@ p dec@@ io od@@ done said the agency believes the oil could have been spilled by a tanker transporting the crude far from the brazilian coast , but added this possibility has not yet been confirmed yet . an an@@ p statement said there were no reports of sp@@ ills by any operator of oil drilling ri@@ gs in the country .
some marine turtles were contaminated by the oil . they were rescued alive in the state of rio grande do nor@@ te and sent to rehabilitation centers . other animals were found dead , ib@@ ama said , without dis@@ closing species or numbers .
petro@@ bras , as the state oil company is known , said in a statement that even though it was not involved in the spill it was contributing to the clean@@ -@@ up efforts , with some 100 petro@@ bras employees helping clean the beaches .
sk@@ oda to provide drivers with voice activated digital assistant
sk@@ oda is to introduce a digital assistant that can be activated with a verbal command . in an announcement wednesday , the czech car maker said the digital assistant could be activated by the phrase " okay , laura . "
the system , which supports six languages , is able to undertake a range of tasks including starting navigation to a destination and searching for music . it will initially be available in models of the kam@@ iq city suv and the compact scal@@ a . part of the volkswagen group since 1991 , the sk@@ oda brand delivered 1.@@ 25 million vehicles globally in 2018 , according to its annual report .
the company 's introduction of a virtual , voice activated assistant mirrors efforts by other manufacturers in the sector . some bmw cars , for instance , are now equipped with an " intelligent personal assistant " which can be activated by using a button , a personal activation word or the phrase " hello , bmw . " verbal commands can be used to , among other things , activate seat heating , get information on tire pressure , and adjust the in@@ -@@ car temperature .
" voice is the ideal interaction tool in the vehicle , " jack palmer , a senior connected car specialist at s@@ bd automotive , said in a statement sent to cn@@ bc via email on thursday .
" if the lion 's share of commands from the driver can be in@@ pu@@ tted through virtual assistants , rather than fi@@ dd@@ ling around with touch@@ screens and buttons , the current epidemic of driver distraction will be greatly miti@@ gated , " palmer added . " automakers have realized this and the race is on for them to integrate their own solutions or partner with consumer electronics companies such as google and amazon . "
the moves by firms such as sk@@ oda and bmw point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars . hannah kes@@ his@@ hi@@ an , an automotive analyst at market intelligence firm min@@ tel , told cn@@ bc via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40 % of u.s. consumers who owned a vehicle " would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle . " this , she added , " opens the door to greater possibilities for digital assistant vehicle connectivity . "
ghana : world rabies day observed
the 13@@ th world rabies day was marked in ac@@ cr@@ a on wednesday with a call on pet owners to vacc@@ inate their dogs in order to safeguard the lives of the citizen@@ ry .
the programme which was held under the theme " rabies : vacc@@ inate to eliminate " was organised by the food and agriculture organisation ( fao ) in collaboration with the ministry of agriculture veterinary service .
it was aimed at highlighting the essential role of mass canine vaccination in rabies elimination in the country .
addressing the conference , the assistant director general and fao representative to ghana , mr abe@@ be ha@@ ile@@ -@@ gabriel indicated that the issue of rabies could be minim@@ ised if efforts were ge@@ ared towards vaccination and keeping stray animals away from humans especially children .
according to him , the ' zero by 30 ' global strategic plan " of the 500,000 people who died from rabies each year , 40 per cent are children living in asia and africa , " and called for holistic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rabies .
mr ha@@ ile@@ -@@ gabriel stated that most stray animals carried rabies and re@@ -@@ echoed the need for the country to supplement the united against rabies 2030 strategy that requires the pet owners to vacc@@ inate animals that carried zo@@ on@@ otic diseases .
he under@@ scored the need for the country to embark on five@@ -@@ year campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rabies .
a comprehensive road@@ map for progressive elimination of rabies , he noted had been rolled out through the ghana rabies and prevention action plan ( 201@@ 8@@ -@@ 2030 ) to end epi@@ demics of neglected tropical diseases by 2030 .
mr ha@@ ile@@ -@@ gabriel pledged the readiness of the fao to collab@@ orate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rabies in the country .
dr owen kal@@ u@@ wa , the world health organisation ( who ) representative to ghana observed that rabies was an endemic which had to be controlled to save lives .
he explained that through the " zero human rabies deaths by 2030 " strategy , countries were supported to develop and implement their national rabies elimination plans that embrace the one health concept and cross sec@@ toral collaboration .
dr kal@@ u@@ wa noted that 99 per cent of zo@@ on@@ otic disease like rabies was transmitted from dogs to humans , adding that one health approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rabies was expe@@ dient .
director of veterinary service , dr as@@ ie@@ du ba@@ ah lam@@ ented that rabies had become global burden .
" though rabies has no cure , the infection is vaccine pre@@ vent@@ able , hence its elimination is feasible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vaccinated , " he stated .
dr ba@@ ah said although rabies was fully pre@@ vent@@ able using appropriate sustainable control strategies , lack of funds and concerted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the endemic .
" it is imperative that the animal sector is adequately resour@@ ced to prevent transmission of rabies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease , " he added .
the 12@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old who " sil@@ enced the world "
gre@@ ta th@@ un@@ berg has established herself as the planet 's spokeswoman on climate change at the tender age of 16 . but long before social media , another teenager was scol@@ ding un leaders on the world stage 27 years ago .
in the year since she organized school walk@@ outs in her native sweden to protest climate change , gre@@ ta th@@ un@@ berg 's environmental crus@@ ade has been unavoidable , cul@@ min@@ ating on monday in an angry and passionate speech before the un 's climate action summit , in which she lam@@ bas@@ ted politicians for stealing her " dreams " and her " childhood " with " empty words " while humanity sta@@ res down " a mass extinction . "
th@@ un@@ berg 's grim pronoun@@ cements have earned her savage criticism , and glowing praise . new york magazine called her " the joan of arc of climate change , " while the guardian ranked her speech alongside president lincoln 's get@@ ty@@ sburg address for its historical significance .
then again , they said the same about sever@@ n cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki in 1992 . long before th@@ un@@ berg dead@@ pan@@ ned to parliament@@ arians that " we probably don 't even have a future any more , " and netizens tore each other to sh@@ reds attacking and defending her , 12@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki became known as the " the girl who sil@@ enced the world for five minutes " when she delivered a similar ser@@ mon before the un earth summit in rio de janeiro .
the tone of cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki 's speech is stri@@ kingly similar to th@@ un@@ berg 's . " we 've come ... to tell you adults that you must change your ways , " she opened , just like th@@ un@@ berg told the assembled adults " we will not let you get away with this . "
just as th@@ un@@ berg told the un summit " we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fair@@ y@@ tales of eternal economic growth , " cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki told leaders that " losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market . "
and under@@ p@@ inning both girls " messages was a ni@@ hil@@ istic fat@@ alism . " i am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone . i am afraid to breathe the air because i don 't know what chemicals are in it , " cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki said in 1992 . striking school@@ children in 2019 carry banners reading " you 'll die of old age , i 'll die of climate change . "
the environmental problems addressed by cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki reflect the world of the early 199@@ 0@@ s , when de@@ forestation , the deple@@ tion of the ozone layer , and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de j@@ our . yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the interven@@ ing years . thanks to a landmark chemicals ban , ozone deple@@ tion has slowed dramatically , and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of texas and alaska combined .
cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki herself went on to found an environmental think tank and work for un secretary general k@@ of@@ i annan 's special advisory panel in the early 200@@ 0@@ s .
so what does the future have in store for th@@ un@@ berg ? well that depends how you look at cul@@ lis@@ -@@ suzuki 's example . on one hand , none of her worst fears came to pass . on the other , world governments still have ecological problems to contend with , and are still being lec@@ tured by children about them .
assuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as th@@ un@@ berg says it won 't unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long un and n@@ go career that kicked off with one famous speech .
by then , another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the martian colonies .
sn@@ p could support jeremy cor@@ by@@ n as temporary pm to stop no@@ -@@ deal brexit
the sn@@ p has sign@@ alled it could support installing jeremy cor@@ by@@ n in dow@@ ning street on a temporary basis to th@@ wart a no@@ -@@ deal brexit .
as tensions between mps and dow@@ ning street deepened , nic@@ ola stur@@ geon suggested it could row in behind the labour leader as a care@@ taker prime minister until a general election .
mr cor@@ by@@ n called on rebel tories and opposition mps to back him to lead a temporary administration in august - but the move was met with resistance , particularly from the liberal democrat leader jo s@@ win@@ son .
under the proposals , opposition parties would seek to ou@@ st boris johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the uk crashing out of the eu on 31 october .
the plan failed to gain cross@@ -@@ party support at the time , but senior figures in the sn@@ p are concerned that mr johnson could def@@ y a law forcing him to delay brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 october .
nic@@ ola stur@@ geon , the sn@@ p leader , suggested that mr cor@@ by@@ n could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving mr johnson in charge would be a " terrible idea . "
responding to a tweet suggesting installing the labour leader or another temporary prime minister , she said : " agree with this .
" vote of no confidence , opposition uni@@ tes around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension , and then immediate general election .
" nothing is risk free but leaving johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me . "
veteran mps harri@@ et har@@ man and ken clar@@ ke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior sn@@ p source insisted it had to be the labour leader .
" it is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence , so that we can request a delay to brexit and hold an election , " the source told it@@ v 's robert pe@@ ston .
" trying to find a compromise candidate , a national unity candidate , is too complicated , especially in the time we have . whether people like it or not , the temporary prime minister has to be cor@@ by@@ n . "
an sn@@ p spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no@@ -@@ deal brexit and removing " this dangerous and un@@ democratic prime minister as soon as possible . "
the spokesperson said : " it is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of boris johnson and his cr@@ on@@ ies , who are determined to find a way to get around the ben@@ n act , but is instead sent by a temporary care@@ taker prime minister , who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter , with an election held immediately afterwards .
" we remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no@@ -@@ deal brexit and getting rid of boris johnson . "
even with sn@@ p support , it would come down to a kni@@ fe@@ -@@ edge vote for mr cor@@ by@@ n . there are 2@@ 88 tory mps , as well as 10 democratic union@@ ists , so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent mps to come on board .
labour argued that the plan was the " simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal . "
however the liberal democrats believe a temporary government led by mr cor@@ by@@ n cannot achieve the necessary support across the house , as he would need the backing of ex@@ -@@ tory mps and defec@@ tors from his own party .
kir@@ st@@ ene hair , tory mp for ang@@ us , said : " this report confirms what many have long suspected - sn@@ p mps will happily prop up jeremy cor@@ by@@ n in no@@ 10 .
" there is no doubt that cor@@ by@@ n 's weak stance on in@@ dy@@ ref@@ 2 is a deciding factor for the nation@@ alists .
" he has already left the door open for a re@@ -@@ run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister .
" only a conservative government will stand up for those who voted " no " in what was meant to be a once in a generation event . "
over 50 sur@@ rey university students banned from sports teams amid accusations of sexual harassment
" people are just doing everything you would expect from a lad@@ s holiday . it is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy , ra@@ uc@@ ous trip . "
however , students said that this year behaviour of some students went too far , particularly during a game which involved members of the football club being dared by their teammates to make advances on women , while their friends attempt to " intercept " them .
alan su@@ ther@@ land , chief executive of sur@@ rey 's student unions said : " we became aware of the misconduct , and as investigations proceeded any individual students who were accused of committing a " major " offence as per the student disciplinary regulations were referred to a university investigation . "
three students were formally disciplined by the university , which launched its own investigation into the football team 's conduct .
one student was expelled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment , and one count of aggressive behaviour .
meanwhile two other students , who were also accused of harassment , were issued with final warnings and made to issue apologies .
one was banned from university premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events . all three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies .
the sur@@ rey university men 's football club said that they " sincerely apolog@@ ise " for its members actions during the croatia tour .
matt de gro@@ od shouldn 't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma
in 2016 , matthew de gro@@ od , the man who killed five people at a house party in cal@@ gary , was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions .
now , in 2019 , there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms , such as un@@ supervised out@@ ings . the decision won 't come for a few more weeks , so in the meantime we 're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea . there are two sides to this : one citing his violent behaviour in the past , calling to prevent it from happening again , and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation .
first , let 's examine the more pessimistic side . de gro@@ od did stab and kill five people during a psycho@@ tic break . it was a violent and unpredictable attack . he suffers from schizophrenia , which is why he was found not criminally responsible , but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication . his psychiatrist , dr. san@@ to@@ ch ra@@ i , has said in front of the review board that " if matthew de gro@@ od were to commit another offence , it would be severe . " despite his perceived improvement , there is still risk of re@@ -@@ offense . but is this reason enough to remain afraid ? is it enough to keep de gro@@ od locked up ?
as long as de gro@@ od continues to take his medication , there isn 't a huge risk of re@@ offense , so why are people so concerned ? i believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness , particularly those with schizophrenia , largely influences this fear . certain mental illnesses have become less stig@@ ma@@ tized , such as mood and anxiety disorders . but others , including schizophrenia , remain highly stig@@ ma@@ tized . this is in large part due to numerous portra@@ y@@ als of schizophren@@ ics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people .
that was the case in this situation , but these instances are rare , and that 's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur . in fact , the majority of schizophren@@ ic individuals are non@@ violent , and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence . in light of this , it seems unreasonable to insist that de gro@@ od be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re@@ -@@ offense is based more on a prejud@@ iced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood .
i don 't believe de gro@@ od should ever be un@@ supervised permanently . a par@@ ole@@ -@@ like system where he has to check in to make sure he 's still taking his medication could work well . arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institution@@ alized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation . it perpe@@ tu@@ ates the idea that mentally ill people , those with schizophrenia in particular , cannot ever mesh with society ; thus continuing the stigma and perpe@@ tu@@ ating the idea that they are dangerous criminals . he was found not criminally responsible by a court of law , so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better ?
hungarian pm or@@ ban defen@@ ds his candidate for eu executive , " has solutions in pocket "
prime minister vi@@ k@@ tor or@@ ban has said he has several solutions " in his pocket " after hungary 's candidate for the european commission was rejected .
the eu transport commis@@ sion@@ er@@ -@@ desig@@ nate , roman@@ ian socialist politician ro@@ vana plum@@ b , and the proposed commissioner for eu enlargement , former hungarian justice minister las@@ z@@ lo tro@@ cs@@ anyi , were told their confirmation hearings could not go ahead because of in@@ consist@@ encies in their financial statements , reuters reported .
" i am convinced that [ tro@@ cs@@ anyi ] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the european commission , " or@@ ban said . " his sin was that he helped the government and me ... to protect hungary from migration . "
the move is seen as an embarrassment for or@@ ban , who proposed tro@@ cs@@ anyi , and who has been in constant conflict with brussels over his migration policy and other issues .
babies on a plane : japan airlines unve@@ ils tool to tackle horror of screaming infants
being stuck on a long@@ -@@ haul flight within ear@@ shot of a crying baby could be a thing of the past for passengers on japan airlines ( j@@ al ) , after the carrier unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where todd@@ lers will be seated .
when passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat , a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan , aler@@ ting other passengers who have yet to select their seats .
j@@ al was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of ear@@ shot of a screaming infant .
the icon would not appear if passengers booked their flight through a third party or were part of a tour group , or if there was a last@@ -@@ minute change of aircraft , the airline 's website said .
j@@ al and other airlines have yet to come up with way of antici@@ pating seat reservations by serial sno@@ rers and passengers who fully re@@ cline their seats during in@@ -@@ flight meals .
but the move attracted praise from some social media users .
" thank you , @ j@@ al _ official _ jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip , " ra@@ hat ahmed , a businessman , twee@@ ted . " this really ought to be mandatory across the board . "
others , though , cas@@ ti@@ gated travellers for in@@ tolerance towards fellow passengers .
" they are babies , as we all once were . we need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth brea@@ thers , dro@@ ol@@ ers , far@@ ters , drun@@ ks , and perhaps a lot more things in life , " one user said .
pompe@@ o ac@@ cuses syria of using chemical weapons in may attack
secretary of state mike pompe@@ o , speaking on the sidelines of the u.@@ n@@ . general assembly on thursday , said the united states has concluded the syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year .
pompe@@ o said u.s. officials had determined syrian president bashar assad 's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in id@@ li@@ b province on may 19 .
" the assad regime is responsible for in@@ numer@@ able atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , " pompe@@ o told a news conference .
u.s. officials in may said they 'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time .
in april 2018 , the u.s. , britain and france launched air@@ strikes in syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month .
" this is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that president trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons , " pompe@@ o said .
he added that the u.s. would provide an additional $ 4.5 million to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected syrian chemical@@ -@@ weapons use .
pompe@@ o also called on the assad government to release thousands of un@@ just@@ ly detained prisoners , including american journalist austin tice , who has been missing and presum@@ ed held by the government for seven years .
" he is just one of a number of american citizens held in syria and we call upon the syrian regime to release them all . "

el@@ on musk , co@@ -@@ founder and chief executive officer of tesla motors .
shares of tesla jumped more than 5 % after elec@@ trek , an electric vehicle news website , reported that ceo el@@ on musk said the company " has a shot " at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter , which would be a new record .

greece : 5 deny poor women 's babies sold in illegal adop@@ tions
five greek and geor@@ gian citizens have appeared in court on charges of belonging to a criminal organization that allegedly sold babies for adoption .
all five denied the charges before a th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ki magistrate on friday . the two geor@@ gian nationals are accused of being the ring@@ leaders .
the gang allegedly recruited pregnant bul@@ garian women who were des@@ titu@@ te and willing to give up newborns they might deliver . authorities say the group sold babies to child@@ less greek couples .
a total 12 people were arrested this week in connection with the alleged illegal adop@@ tions and the alleged sale of human eggs . another 54 have been charged with compl@@ icity .
police say it was one of the biggest and best@@ -@@ organized gangs of its kind in europe . the continent 's euro@@ pol police agency assisted the investigation .
mike pompe@@ o says syrian government used chlorine in may chemical weapon attack
mike pompe@@ o , the us secretary of state , said on thursday that the united states had concluded the syrian government had used chlorine as a chemical weapon in an attack in may during a battle with insurg@@ ents in id@@ li@@ b .
" the assad regime is responsible for in@@ numer@@ able atrocities , some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity , " mr pompe@@ o told a news conference in new york , where he has been attending the united nations general assembly .
" today i am announcing that the united states has concluded that the assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon on may 19 , " mr pompe@@ o added .
the united states said in may it had received numerous reports that appeared consistent with chemical exposure after an attack by the forces of bashar al@@ -@@ assad , the syrian president , in northwestern syria , but it had made no definitive conclusion as to whether they used chemical weapons .
the trump administration has twice bombed syria over assad 's suspected use of chemical weapons , in april 2017 and april 2018 .
father remains hopeful that suspect who fat@@ ally shot son one year ago will be caught
it 's been one year since a 20@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old from long beach was fat@@ ally shot , but the victim 's family isn 't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught .
" i wish i could trade places with you son , i wish i could trade places with you , " guy al@@ ford , the victim 's father , said .
al@@ ford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son , guy al@@ ford iii , was gun@@ ned down at a jack in the box near 5@@ 2@@ nd and atlantic . he said he wanted to call attention to his son 's un@@ solved murder .
" somebody knows something , they need to say something , " he said .
security video , which has never been released , showed al@@ ford stopped in the drive@@ -@@ thr@@ u when a second car pulled up behind him . three suspects were then seen getting out of that car . one of them walked up to the driver 's side , and shot al@@ ford . the four people in al@@ ford 's car jumped out and ran . the suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away .
" wherever this coward is , he will get caught , " al@@ ford said .
this griev@@ ing father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son , and he said he still didn 't know who was in the car with him when he was shot .
" they u@@ pped and ran out of my son 's car like that , where did you run to , " al@@ ford said . " did you go back and try to help him or what ? nobody said nothing . "
al@@ ford said his son was a star football player at ale@@ many high school , then a stand@@ -@@ out safety on the long beach city college football team . al@@ ford said his son was working toward playing for a division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse .
" he was working three jobs , " michael harvey , a friend , said . " as somebody who 's 21 , he was a year younger than me , anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic , you tend to look up to . "
as the investigation into the fatal shooting continues , al@@ ford said he wasn 't giving up either .
" i can assure you , this one is going to get solved , " he said .
al@@ ford is personally offering a $ 2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction . anyone with information about this crime is urged to call long beach police .
brexit can get plenty more toxic from here
humiliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awa@@ its johnson in brussels if he tries to weas@@ el out of his commitments to request an extension . that will comfort european officials , who would most probably agree to it . mainly because taking more time to find a solution reduces the threat of a no@@ -@@ deal brexit , which would be economically harmful to both sides .
yet european diplomats can also see that the political bed@@ lam in the uk len@@ ds itself to delay without decisions . lawmakers in parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie johnson 's hands and seek an extension , but that 's about all they can agree on . this is the same parliament that rejected the former prime minister the@@ resa may 's hard@@ -@@ fought brexit deal with the eu three times . unless there 's an election - another decision on which mps have a final say - that won 't change .
but even an election is a grim prospect for european capitals hoping for a friendly resolution to the brexit mess . the opposition labour party 's brexit policy is a painful cont@@ or@@ tion act that 's almost impossible to understand ; the centr@@ ist liberal democrats ' idea to cancel brexit altogether is seen as extreme . the longer this dra@@ gs on , the more it eats away at the smooth functioning of the eu .
there might be more optimism in brussels if the outline of a work@@ able deal was already sitting on a desk somewhere in the european commission 's ber@@ lay@@ mont headquarters . but there isn 't .
johnson 's regular bas@@ hing of his predecessor 's " back@@ stop " proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in ireland and protect the eu single market hasn 't led to any convincing alternatives . officials say the proposals sent in by the uk on alternative arrangements aren 't concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an october 31 exit .
and johnson 's weakness will give the 27 leaders facing him even less incentive to erase crucial red lines , despite the claim by michael go@@ ve , the uk minister in charge of a no@@ -@@ deal brexit , that they 're " shifting " on the back@@ stop .
in an ideal world , a series of blows landing on johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over brexit - would bring the match closer to an end . europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the uk , given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this dra@@ gs on . if there 's a window to try yet again to put a deal before the uk parliament , the eu should grab it .
but this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home .
the eu is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them ; it 's less good at unilaterally imposing its will . the uk is he@@ mmed in by its own internal contradictions , at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the imp@@ asse .
brexit can get plenty more toxic from here .
black hole swallowing and ri@@ pping apart star captured for first time
a gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ri@@ pping apart a star for the first time .
the star , which was about the same size as our sun , was seen from 3@@ 75 million light years away war@@ ping and spir@@ alling into the gravitational pull of a super@@ massive black hole , researchers said in the astro@@ physical journal .
it was then sucked into obli@@ vi@@ on in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event .
nasa 's plan@@ et@@ -@@ searching telescope , the trans@@ iting exo@@ planet survey satellite - tess - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time .
astronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at tess , whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets , caught the beginning of the violent event .
thomas holo@@ i@@ en , an astronom@@ er for the carnegie institution for science who led the research , said : " this was really a combination of both being good and being lucky , and sometimes that 's what you need to push the science forward . "
stars get sucked in when they venture too close to a super@@ massive black hole , which lives at the centre of most galaxies , including the earth 's milky way .
the black hole 's impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart , with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole , forming a disc of hot , bright gas as it is swallowed .
mr holo@@ i@@ en added : " specifically , we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brigh@@ tening , and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique . "
uk business committee to probe thomas cook collapse
the uk 's civil aviation authority said today that 72 flights are scheduled to operate to bring back a further 16@@ ,000 people to the country following the collapse of travel group thomas cook .
the aviation regulator said it has brought back over 40 % of the total number of passengers in the largest peace@@ time repatriation ' operation mat@@ ter@@ horn ' launched on monday .
meanwhile , the british parliament 's business committee has launched an inquiry into the collapse of thomas cook and will seek to question the management over issues such as executive pay and accounting practices .
thomas cook , the world 's oldest tour operator , collapsed in the early hours of monday , hitting hotel owners , tourist sites and resorts around the world .
" the main players in the sad demise of britain 's oldest travel firm should face public scrutiny and be held to account for their actions before the company collapsed , " said rachel re@@ eves , chair of the business , energy and industrial strategy ( be@@ is ) committee .
evidence hearings will begin in mid@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ late october .
" directors will welcome the opportunity to set the record straight and demonstrate that their conduct was always in the best interests of thomas cook 's customers , employees and stakeholders , " a person familiar with the company told reuters .
why the times published details of the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower 's identity
on thursday , the times published exclusive details about the identity of the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower whose claims led democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against president trump this week . ( the article reported that the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower is a c@@ .@@ i.@@ a. officer who was previously detailed to work at the white house and had expertise on ukraine . )
many readers , including some who work in national security and intelligence , have criticized the times 's decision to publish the details , saying it potentially put the person 's life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would@@ -@@ be whist@@ le@@ -@@ blow@@ ers .
we took their concerns to dean ba@@ quet , the times 's executive editor , who responded to them in a discussion with the reader center :
the president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower , who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding . the president himself has called the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower 's account a " political hack job . "
we decided to publish limited information about the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower - including the fact that he works for a non@@ political agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the white house - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible .
china says it didn 't fight any war nor invaded foreign land
china on friday said it has not provoked a " single war or conflict " or " invaded a single square " of foreign land , skir@@ ting any reference to the 1962 war with india .
" china has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime del@@ imitation disputes through negotiation and consultation , " stated an official white paper released , four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70@@ th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling communist party of china ( cpc ) on october 1 .
" china safeguards world peace through real actions . over the past 70 years , china has not provoked a single war or conflict , nor invaded a single square of foreign land , " the paper titled " china and the world in the new era " said .
the white paper , while highlighting the c@@ ps 's " peaceful rise " made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with india and the vast trac@@ ts of land , especially in the ak@@ sai chin area , occupied by china .
the sino@@ -@@ india border dispute involving 3,@@ 4@@ 88@@ -@@ k@@ m@@ -@@ long line of actual control ( lac ) remained unresolved . china also claims ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al pra@@ des@@ h as part of south tibet , which india con@@ tests .
so far , the two countries held 21 rounds of special representatives talks to resolve the border dispute .
besides the 1962 war , india and china had a major military stan@@ doff at dok@@ lam in 2017 when the people 's liberation army ( pla ) tried to lay a road close to india " s narrow chicken neck corridor connecting with the north@@ -@@ eastern states in an area also claimed by bhu@@ tan .
it was finally diplom@@ a@@ tically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops .
china also had a major military conflict with vietnam in 1979 . china claims sovereignty over all of south china sea . vietnam , malaysia , the philippines , brunei and taiwan have counter claims .
" china has achieved full resolution of land border del@@ imitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries , and del@@ ine@@ ated the china@@ -@@ vietnam maritime boundary in the bei@@ bu gulf , " the white paper said , noting that since reform and opening up in 1978 , the country has cut its armed forces " by over four million . "
the two@@ -@@ million strong chinese military still remain the world 's largest .
prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of india
india 's monsoon season has over@@ run by almost a month , with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collap@@ sing buildings and many crops beginning to rot .
normally the monsoon in north india rec@@ ed@@ es by the beginning of september , but the average rainfall this month has been 37 % above normal . if the situation continues for the remaining few days , it will be the latest the monsoon has ever rec@@ eded in decades , according to experts in the india meteorological department .
many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain , the latest being the town of pun@@ e in western india , where tor@@ ren@@ tial rain on wednesday and thursday caused several deaths and ha@@ voc from collapsed buildings .
homes were flooded and people w@@ aded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon .
other cities such as kol@@ k@@ ata , luc@@ know and hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad have also experienced heavy rainfall . u@@ tt@@ ar@@ ak@@ hand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains .
the monsoon was also late to arrive . many areas suffered water shortages and farmers brac@@ ed themselves for a possible drought .
the extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers . " this amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year . it is making my vegetables - i 've got cabbage , beans , peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot , " said pra@@ k@@ ash me@@ h@@ ra , a small farmer in b@@ him@@ tal in u@@ tt@@ ar@@ ak@@ hand .
for consumers , the impact of the delayed and now late@@ -@@ rec@@ eding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions , an essential ingredient in indian food . onions are selling at 80 rupees ( about £ 1 ) a kil@@ o in cities such as delhi and mumbai , as opposed to the normal 20 rupees ( 23@@ p ) .
festivals are also at risk . the next big festival is dus@@ se@@ h@@ ra on 8 october , when hindu@@ s erect giant , comic book@@ -@@ style eff@@ ig@@ ies of ra@@ vana , a figure from the hindu epic the ra@@ may@@ ana who sports a bu@@ shy mou@@ stache and an evil grin .
burning ra@@ vana symbol@@ ises the triumph of good over evil . but given that the eff@@ ig@@ ies are made of paper , if the monsoon continues , ra@@ vana might have the last laugh .
julian ass@@ ange : private security firm ' sp@@ ied on wi@@ kil@@ eaks founder in ecu@@ ad@@ orian embassy for ci@@ a@@ '
a spanish private security company hired to protect the ecu@@ ad@@ orian embassy in london when julian ass@@ ange lived there sp@@ ied on the wi@@ kil@@ eaks founder for the us intelligence service , it has been claimed .
a report in spanish newspaper el pa@@ is said the company , uc global sl , allegedly handed over audio and video to the cia of meetings ass@@ ange held with his lawyers .
the company is being investigated over the claims by spain 's high court , the audi@@ en@@ cia nac@@ ional , said the report .
ass@@ ange filed a criminal complaint himself , in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the secrecy of his cli@@ ent@@ -@@ attorney privileges .
el pa@@ is said uc global sl had failed to respond to requests for comment on the claims .
in april , ass@@ ange was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the british authorities by ecuador .
he took refuge there in 2012 while on bail and facing extradition to sweden over sex assault allegations , saying he feared extradition to the us if he left over the activities of wi@@ kil@@ eaks .
the us formally requested his extradition in june on 18 charges , including computer mis@@ use and the un@@ author@@ ised disclosure of national defence information .
he is accused of working with former us army intelligence analyst chelsea man@@ ning .
he is now in bel@@ marsh prison in london after being j@@ ailed for violating bail conditions imposed over the swedish extradition request and was due to be released last week , but was re@@ man@@ ded in custody pending a hearing of the us extradition case in london in february 2020 .
in may , swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into an alleg@@ ation of rape against ass@@ ange - an alleg@@ ation he has always denied .

why we still need gandhi
the leaders of the world 's two largest democr@@ acies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 15@@ 0@@ th birthday we are currently celebrating .
mo@@ hand@@ as kar@@ am@@ ch@@ and " ma@@ hat@@ ma " gandhi , who was born on oc@@ t@@ . 2 , 18@@ 69 , left a worldwide legacy with his focus on ethics , non@@ violence , tolerance and social justice . he had a profound impact on two of the most important mass mobil@@ izations in the united states .
the influence of gandhi on the civil rights movement actually started well before the rev@@ . martin luther king 's embrace of his ideals , with afric@@ an@@ -@@ american activists such as howard thur@@ man and benjamin ma@@ ys undertaking long sea voy@@ ages to india to meet gandhi .
and ces@@ ar chavez , who modeled many of his tactics on gandhi 's in leading the farm@@ workers " movement , traced his political awakening to a news@@ reel he watched at the age of 11 or 12 showing that " this half@@ -@@ naked man without a gun had conquered the might of the british empire . "
outside the united states , gandhi had a similar effect . nelson mandela , the dalai lama , nobel peace pri@@ ze@@ -@@ winner mal@@ ala you@@ saf@@ zai and climate change activists , to give just a few examples , have acknowledged gandhi as a guiding light .
but president donald trump and indian prime minister na@@ ren@@ dra modi , who triumph@@ antly addressed a joint mega@@ -@@ rally in houston recently , seem to be imper@@ vious to gandhi 's ideas , despite paying lip service to him at the event . both are right@@ -@@ wing pop@@ u@@ lists who have ruled with sc@@ ant compassion or tolerance , successfully mobilizing whites and hindu@@ s in their respective countries as voting bloc@@ s , and f@@ omen@@ ting division and social antagon@@ ism .
modi has belonged , since he was 8 years old , to a hindu nationalist organization known as the r@@ ss , an ex@@ -@@ member of which , na@@ thur@@ am god@@ se , assass@@ inated gandhi on jan@@ . 30 , 1948 . indeed , parliament@@ arians from modi 's ruling b@@ har@@ ati@@ ya jan@@ ata party have he@@ aped praise on gandhi 's killer in recent years .
the modi government 's un@@ -@@ gand@@ hi@@ an approach has manifested itself on many fronts . it has stripped the mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority province of jam@@ mu and kashmir of its autonomy and state@@ hood and put it into lockdown . it has proven un@@ welcoming to the mostly muslim ro@@ hing@@ ya refugees who have fled from extreme persecution in myanmar .
and modi 's government has created an uproar by institu@@ ting a national registry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of as@@ sam to o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly catch non@@ citizens from neighboring mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority bangladesh , a step that may end up dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ising and impris@@ oning almost 2 million people .
trump is singing from a similar song@@ book . his administration 's mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority travel ban echoes the islam@@ opho@@ bia that often in@@ forms modi 's policy@@ making . its call@@ ousness toward refugees mirrors the indian government 's disda@@ in for the ro@@ hing@@ ya population 's suffering , and its detention camps parallel the ones the modi regime is setting up . trump 's stirring of racial ani@@ mo@@ sity is anal@@ og@@ ous to troublesome rhetoric from a number of modi 's cabinet members .
there was a teach@@ able moment for the two leaders at their recent joint rally . house majority leader sten@@ y ho@@ yer at the event quoted gandhi 's definition of democracy as " something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong . "
trump and modi would do very well to keep gandhi 's advice in mind , 150 years after his birth .
trump nom@@ inates peter ga@@ y@@ nor to be fe@@ ma chief : white house
federal emergency management agency ( fe@@ ma ) acting administrator peter ga@@ y@@ nor smiles as he testi@@ fies before a senate appropri@@ ations homeland security subcommittee hearing on fe@@ ma 's f@@ y@@ 2020 budget request on capitol hill in washington , u.s. , april 3 , 2019 .
u.s. president donald trump nominated peter ga@@ y@@ nor on thursday to head the federal emergency management agency ( fe@@ ma ) , the white house said in a statement .
ga@@ y@@ nor , fe@@ ma 's deputy administrator , had been acting chief of the agency , which over@@ sees the government response to disasters like hurric@@ anes and wild@@ fires .
the agency has been without a sen@@ ate@@ -@@ confirmed administrator since march , when bro@@ ck long left the post . long resigned after the department of homeland security , under which fe@@ ma falls , concluded long had in@@ appropriately used government vehicles to comm@@ ute between washington and his home in north carolina .
a different nominee for the job , jeffrey by@@ ard , was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month , after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a bar@@ room bra@@ wl .
ga@@ y@@ nor 's nomination to the post was expected . he will require a majority of the senate to approve the nomination to take the job .
before becoming fe@@ ma 's deputy administrator in 2018 , ga@@ y@@ nor worked in emergency management in rho@@ de island and was a marine , the white house said .
man set ali@@ ght on doorstep ' in targeted att@@ ack@@ '
a man has been set ali@@ ght on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack .
the 48@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old was soaked in flammable liquid , believed to be petrol , before bursting into flames outside his home in sk@@ el@@ mer@@ s@@ dale , west lanc@@ ash@@ ire .
he is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns .
police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man 's house at about 1@@ am on thursday .
detective chief inspector paul@@ ine stab@@ les , leading the investigation , said : " this is a horri@@ fic incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital .
" we are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible .
" while we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened , we do believe that the incident was targeted and i would like to stress that i don 't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time .
" someone out there knows who has done this and i would urge them to come forward and speak to us .
" has a loved one come home acting suspici@@ ously , smelling of smoke or petrol or with un@@ explained injuries ?
" we need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime . "
vulnerable de@@ ms air impeachment concerns to pel@@ osi
during the meeting , several members made clear their stance that democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the ukraine matter -@@ - allegations that trump asked the ukrainian president to initiate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -@@ - and not the other instances of potential wrong@@ doing detailed in the report from special counsel robert mu@@ eller .
democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy , with pel@@ osi saying during her press conference on thursday morning that the whist@@ le@@ blower complaint is " the focus of the moment . "
by keeping the impeachment inquiry focused , leaders hope to keep the cauc@@ us unified -@@ - with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings . the ukraine matter is also relatively clear@@ -@@ cut and easy to explain to the public , lawmakers say . they also argue the probe , spear@@ headed by the intelligence committee , will be able to move faster -@@ - possibly in the next month or two -@@ - with a narro@@ wer scope .
rep@@ . angie craig , a vulnerable freshman democrat from minnesota , who said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry said after the meeting that pel@@ osi and democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers .
" i 'm in a district where i 've been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where i want to be disciplined , i want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -@@ - and this process will allow us to do that , " craig said , adding she backed a narrow probe led by the house intelligence committee .
rep@@ . matt car@@ tw@@ right , a democrat from pennsylvania , told cnn that he wouldn 't -@@ - at this point -@@ - vote for articles of impeachment .
" i would vote no right now because we haven 't seen all the facts , " car@@ tw@@ right said . " we have to pre@@ sume that people are innocent , don 't we , and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation , if if all that is true . "
democrats will hear from constituents about their moves toward impeachment soon , with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two@@ -@@ week recess at the start of october . it will be the first time a s@@ wat@@ h of members from more conservative districts will receive clear , in@@ -@@ person feedback -@@ - or , in some cases , blow@@ back -@@ - from the people they represent since they joined calls for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the ukraine allegations earlier this week .
but rep@@ . dan kil@@ dee , a michigan democrat , said the timing of the recess has its up@@ sides .
" i really can 't think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward , " he told reporters . " it 's actually good timing that we get a chance to go home , catch our breath , get the perspective of people back home , explain what we 're doing , and then come back and move forward accordingly . "
once lawmakers return , though , movement is likely to be quick .
" i think it 's everybody 's intention here to get this done in 2019 , " said rep@@ . jamie ras@@ kin , an impeachment advocate and member of the judiciary committee .
" the cauc@@ us is unified around the law@@ lessness and corruption pouring forth from the white house , and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country , " the maryland democrat told reporters on thursday night . " we need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public . and if we do our job right , it will be a uni@@ fying exercise for the whole country . "
rep@@ . anthony br@@ in@@ dis@@ i , a freshman from new york who has resisted calls for an impeachment probe , told cnn that he 's " not yet " there on impe@@ aching trump .
" while i find many of the statements in the whist@@ le@@ blower 's report disturbing , there 's a lot more information that 's out there , " br@@ in@@ dis@@ i said . " we have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes . "
more than half the members of the us house of representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry , according to a cnn count . however , that count includes many democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impe@@ ach trump . even if the house could pass the vote , it likely would go nowhere in the republic@@ an@@ -@@ controlled senate , one of many reasons the issue has been politically di@@ vis@@ ive in the party .
still there has been a surge in support -@@ - more than 75 house members in about three days -@@ - of launching such an inquiry as part of the fall@@ out from trump 's july 25 call with ukrainian president vol@@ o@@ dy@@ my@@ r z@@ el@@ en@@ sky where he discussed former vice president joe biden . there is no evidence of wrong@@ doing by biden .
trump official says lawyers had ukraine call transcript moved to secure system
a senior trump administration official acknowledged friday that white house lawyers directed moving the transcript of president trump 's july phone call with ukrainian president vol@@ o@@ dy@@ my@@ r z@@ el@@ en@@ sky to a highly secure system .
other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known , beyond the allegations contained in the whist@@ le@@ blower complaint about that call .
the whist@@ le@@ blower complaint , which was decl@@ assi@@ fied by the trump administration and released to the public on thursday by the house intelligence committee , al@@ leges that white house officials said they were " directed " by white house attor@@ neys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept .
the whist@@ le@@ blower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information . the whist@@ le@@ blower also said that , according to white house officials , it was " not the first time " a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national secur@@ ity@@ -@@ sensitive information . the complaint alleged that the white house tried to " restrict access " to records of the call .
" in the days following the phone call , i learned from multiple u.s. officials that senior white house officials had intervened to " lock down " all records of the phone call , especially the official word@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ word transcript of the call that was produced - as customary - by the white house situation room , " the whist@@ le@@ blower stated .
the white house released an un@@ classified version of that transcript of the call on wednesday . the memo , which does not reflect a " ver@@ ba@@ tim transcript " but is based on " notes and rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tions " of those mem@@ ori@@ alizing the call , shows trump seeking assistance in investigating the bid@@ ens .
" the other thing , there is a lot of talk about biden 's son , that biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great , " he said . " biden went around bra@@ gging that he stopped the prosecution , so if you can look into it ... sounds horrible to me . "
this refers to joe biden , while vice president , urging ukraine to fire its top prosecutor vi@@ k@@ tor sho@@ kin who was investigating the natural gas firm bur@@ is@@ ma holdings - where his son , hunter biden , was on the board . biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention .
but the whist@@ le@@ blower 's complaint al@@ leges that trump was solic@@ iting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign . the whist@@ le@@ blower acknowledged in the complaint , though , that the concerns were based on second@@ -@@ hand information .
the white house lawyers " directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top democrats as a " cover@@ -@@ up . "
house speaker nancy pel@@ osi , d@@ -@@ cal@@ if . , who was prompted by ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president , called the move a " cover@@ -@@ up " and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry .
meanwhile , trump lawyer jay se@@ ku@@ low down@@ played the importance of the recor@@ d@@ -@@ keeping details .
" a cover@@ -@@ up ? think about that for a moment , " se@@ ku@@ low said on " fox & friends " friday . " the white house secured a call with the president of ukraine ? it 's so secret and such a cover@@ -@@ up , here 's the documents . this is nonsense . "
ukraine scandal : pel@@ osi says bar@@ r ' rogue ' ; former u.s. officials back investigation
house speaker nancy pel@@ osi accused u.s. attorney general william bar@@ r friday of going " rogue " to protect president donald trump over his controversial phone call with ukraine 's leader , which has led to an impeachment inquiry .
the california democrat 's words follow a release of the complaint thursday , which was submitted by an unidentified intelligence official to intelligence community inspector general michael at@@ kinson . at@@ kinson turned it over to national intelligence director joseph ma@@ gu@@ ire .
bar@@ r is mentioned several times in the july 25 phone call , as is trump attorney rud@@ ol@@ ph gi@@ u@@ lian@@ i . the complaint says white house officials were concerned enough that they attempted to " lock down " the record of the call .
" [ bar@@ r has ] gone rogue , " pel@@ osi told m@@ sn@@ bc friday . " i think where they 're going is a cover@@ -@@ up of a cover@@ -@@ up . i think it 's sad , to have a justice department go so rogue . well , they have been for a while . and now it just makes matters worse . "
pel@@ osi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after trump acknowledged he 'd with@@ held military aid to ukraine . the aid was ultimately granted , but house democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and trump 's asking z@@ el@@ en@@ sky to investigate hunter biden , who worked for a ukrainian gas company for five years .
also friday , nearly 300 former u.s. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation . the coalition said trump 's actions constitute a " profound national security concern . "
" we applau@@ d those members of congress , including speaker pel@@ osi , who have started us down that necessary path , " the letter states . " president trump appears to have lever@@ aged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process . that would constitute an un@@ consci@@ on@@ able abuse of power .
" it would also represent an effort to subordinate america 's national interests -@@ - and those of our closest allies and partners -@@ - to the president 's personal political interest . "
trump has denied there was any impro@@ pri@@ ety with the phone call . friday , he den@@ ounced the compla@@ in@@ ant and again said the call with z@@ el@@ en@@ sky was a " perfect conversation "
" sounding more and more like the so@@ -@@ called whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower isn 't a whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower at all , " he twee@@ ted . " in addition , all second@@ -@@ hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else , a lea@@ ker or spy , feeding it to him or her ? a partisan operative ? "
vice president mike pence also had interactions with ukrainian leaders , the whist@@ le@@ -@@ blower complaint shows , and he met with z@@ el@@ en@@ sky in poland earlier this month . he said neither joe biden or hunter biden were discussed .
death of chinese activist in police custody prompts calls for investigation into torture
human rights advocates are calling for an investigation into the death of a chinese activist , arrested after holding up a plac@@ ard calling for chinese leader xi jinping to step down .
wang mei@@ yu , 38 , was detained in july after he stood outside the hunan provincial police department holding a sign that called on xi and chinese premier li keqiang to resign and implement universal suff@@ rage in china . he was later charged with " picking quar@@ rels and provoking trouble , " a vague offence often given to dissi@@ dents .
according to wang 's mother and lawyer , he died on monday . wang 's wife cao shu@@ xia received a call from police noti@@ fying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of hengyang where he had been held . the police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death .
according to minsheng guan@@ cha , a chinese human rights group , cao was later able to see wang 's body and saw he was bleeding from his eyes , mouth , ears and nose and there were bruises on his face .
" the chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist wang mei@@ yu and hold the perpetrators of torture and extra@@ judicial killing criminally accountable , " the chinese human rights defenders ( chr@@ d ) said in a statement .
according to radio free asia , cao said police pres@@ sured her to accept their statement that wang 's death had been an accident but she refused . an officer at the hengyang police station said he could not comment on the case . wang 's mother told the guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan ( about $ 2@@ 20,000 ) .
" giving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpetr@@ ator is not true re@@ dress nor will it effectively prevent torture , " said fr@@ ances eve , deputy director of research at chr@@ d .
" especially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coer@@ ced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation . "
wang 's death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer ji si@@ zun , who died in police custody in july , uigh@@ ur scholar muhammad sali@@ h ha@@ jim who died last year . nobel laure@@ ate winner liu xiaob@@ o who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ prison sentence and activist cao shun@@ li died in 2014 , detained after attempting to attend a un session on human rights in china .
since monday , wang 's family has been placed under house arrest , according to chr@@ d . he has two young children . others connected to his case have also come under pressure . late on wednesday , six armed police detained xie yang , a rights lawyer , and chen yan@@ hui , an activist , who had met at a hotel to discuss wang 's case . they were released on thursday .
wang , who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished , has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before .
in 2018 after he held up the plac@@ ard calling for xi 's resignation , he wrote online of how police stor@@ med into his home , ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop .
" these idiots . they can 't understand that even after these years of persecution , including being deprived of water for three days or suffering two hours of electrical needles that caused me to vomit blood , i won 't surrender . "

hong kong police say student arrests at protests increase
hong kong police said friday that students accounted for 29 % of nearly 1,@@ 600 people detained in anti@@ -@@ democracy protests since june and urged young people to take the " straight and narrow path " as more major r@@ allies are planned this weekend .
police public relations chief t@@ se chun@@ -@@ chung said 20@@ 7 high school and university students were detained this month alone despite the resumption of classes after the summer holiday , compared to 2@@ 57 over the jun@@ e@@ -@@ august period .
he said there was a rise in teenagers participating in violent crimes , with some already charged in court . this included a 16@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old charged recently with arson , which carries possible a life imprisonment upon conviction , a 13@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl charged with des@@ ec@@ rating chinese flags and others with attacking police officers and carrying dangerous weapons .
" it is an alarming trend to us , " he said at a news conference . " it is worrying to see these youths breaking the law and possibly having criminal records at such a young and tender age . we appeal to all youngsters to rethink their actions and hope the education sector and parents will help our young people to walk the straight and narrow path . "
young people have largely led the protests that started in june over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw . but the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snow@@ ball@@ ed into a wider anti@@ -@@ china campaign against what protesters say is beijing 's creeping intrusion into hong kong 's autonomy promised when the former british colony returned to chinese rule in 1997 .
protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city 's leaders and an independent inquiry into alleged police bru@@ tality against protesters .
thousands of people staged a peaceful protest at a downtown square friday night against alleged abuse of power by police , waving anti@@ -@@ police banners and chan@@ ting pro@@ -@@ democracy slogans . the government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watch@@ dog agency that critics say is tooth@@ less and has no real investigative powers .
police have approved a major rally in downtown hong kong on saturday organized by the civil human rights front to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the umbrella revolution , when protesters occupied key thor@@ ough@@ fares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suff@@ rage . that movement ended without any government concession .
protesters are also organizing " anti@@ -@@ total@@ it@@ arianism " r@@ allies in hong kong and many cities worldwide on sunday against what they den@@ ounced as china 's tyranny .
t@@ se appealed to protesters to stop hi@@ jacking peaceful protests , like what happened in previous r@@ allies when some lo@@ bbed gasoline bombs , set off street fires and vand@@ alized public utilities . police have responded with tear gas , water cann@@ ons , and other measures , prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force .
the civil human rights front is also planning another big march on oc@@ t@@ . 1 , spar@@ king fears of a bloody show@@ down that could embarrass china 's ruling communist party as it marks its 70@@ th year in power with grand festi@@ vities in beijing . the hong kong government has scaled down national day celebrations by calling off an annual fire@@ work display and moving a reception indoors .
ne@@ stle tigh@@ tens controls on coffee beans after wee@@ d@@ killer scare
the world 's largest coffee company said in a statement friday that it had found gly@@ pho@@ sate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deli@@ veries of green coffee beans .
gly@@ pho@@ sate is the key ingredient in mon@@ san@@ to 's wee@@ d@@ killer , roun@@ dup . in the united states , j@@ uries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to gly@@ pho@@ sate . ba@@ yer , which owns mon@@ san@@ to , says the herb@@ icide is safe when used properly , as does the us environmental protection agency .
neu@@ mann k@@ aff@@ ee gru@@ ppe ( n@@ kg ) , one of the world 's largest traders , said gly@@ pho@@ sate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys . ne@@ stle buys some of its coffee beans from n@@ kg . it was too early to say what consequences ne@@ stle 's tighter controls would have on n@@ kg , a spokesperson said .
ne@@ stle 's ( n@@ sr@@ gf ) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains , a spokesperson said . " this is not a new process , we are just reinforcing controls , " the spokesperson told cnn business . tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin .
ne@@ stle would start with suppliers in indonesia and brazil , since these countries are among the world 's biggest coffee producers .
" our agr@@ onom@@ ists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices , including the appropriate use of her@@ bic@@ ides and adoption of other wee@@ ding methods , " the swiss company said .
brands such as nes@@ cafe and nes@@ pres@@ so make up a si@@ z@@ able chunk of ne@@ stle 's powdered and liquid beverages business , which generated sales of 2@@ 1.6 billion swiss francs ( $ 2@@ 1.7 billion ) in 2018 . ne@@ stle last year agreed a deal to sell starbucks ' packaged coff@@ ees and teas around the world .
does gly@@ pho@@ sate cause cancer ?
gly@@ pho@@ sate is used on more than 100 food crops , according to the epa . scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children .
still , the epa says gly@@ pho@@ sate is not a carcin@@ ogen and that it poses no public health risks . ecological risks include damage to pollin@@ ators and the problem of weed resistance , the epa said in a statement in april .
but that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against mon@@ san@@ to alleg@@ ing that exposure to roun@@ dup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer .
earlier this year , a jury ordered ba@@ yer to pay a california couple $ 2 billion in damages after they claimed that roun@@ dup , used on their property for more than three decades , had given them both non@@ -@@ hodg@@ kin lymphoma within four years of one other . ba@@ yer is con@@ testing the verdict .
a 2015 study by the world health organization 's international agency for research on cancer found that gly@@ pho@@ sate was " probably carcin@@ ogenic to humans , " based on " limited " evidence of cancer in humans and " sufficient " evidence of cancer in experimental animals . however , a joint panel of the who and the united nations food and agriculture organization later concluded that gly@@ pho@@ sate is unlikely to pose a carcin@@ ogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet .
man guilty of killing 6 members of his extended family in texas
a utah man was convicted thursday of killing six members of his extended family in texas and faces the possibility of a death sentence .
a harris county jury found ronald has@@ k@@ ell , 39 , guilty in the july 2014 killings of six members of the stay family : parents stephen stay and katie stay , and children br@@ yan , 13 , emily , 9 , rebecca , 7 and zach , 4 .
" we are grateful for the jur@@ ors ' ra@@ pt attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case , " harris county district attorney kim og@@ g said in a statement . " there was never a reasonable doubt that has@@ k@@ ell me@@ ticul@@ ously planned and carried out the slaughter of the stay family . "
police have said that has@@ k@@ ell traveled from california to the houston suburb of spring and ambu@@ shed his ex@@ -@@ wife 's sister , her husband and their five children in their home .
the stays and four of their children were fat@@ ally shot in the back of their heads , and a fifth child , who was 15 at the time , survived . that teen , cas@@ si@@ dy , was gra@@ zed in the head by a bullet and played dead .
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case , but jur@@ ors will decide whether has@@ k@@ ell should receive a death sentence or life in prison .
at trial , the defense argued that has@@ k@@ ell was insane and heard voices that led him to kill the six people , nbc affili@@ ate k@@ prc of houston reported . after the verdict was read thursday , he hung his head .
" i think he took it as best as you could expect , " said doug dur@@ ham , one of has@@ k@@ ell 's defense attor@@ neys , according to the station . " he was aware that this was a strong possibility . "
the sentencing phase begins monday . has@@ k@@ ell defense attorney neil davis iii said his team will work " to save his life . that 's our job , " according to k@@ prc .
the sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks , the station reported .
cas@@ si@@ dy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members . she appeared to be praying before the guilty verdict was read thursday , according to k@@ prc .
at a 2014 memorial for her family , cas@@ si@@ dy thanked the community for its support and said that she was comforted knowing her parents , two brothers and two sisters are " in a much better place , and that i 'll be able to see them again one day . "
has@@ k@@ ell was disguised as a fe@@ dex delivery driver when he went to the stay home , apparently looking for his ex@@ -@@ wife , who is katie stay 's sister .
he forced his way inside and tied up cas@@ si@@ dy , officials said . when the rest of her family returned minutes later , has@@ k@@ ell tied them up and demanded to know the whereabouts of his ex@@ -@@ wife . they said they didn 't know , and they were each shot in the back of the head .
cas@@ si@@ dy , who was wounded , played dead until has@@ k@@ ell left , and was able to identify him to police . she told officials he was planning to drive to her grandparents ' home and kill them . but police tracked down has@@ k@@ ell , and he was arrested after a 20@@ -@@ minute police chase and a three@@ -@@ hour stan@@ doff .
us deaths could result in scottish ban on vap@@ ing and e@@ -@@ cigarette ads
a ban on advertising for e@@ -@@ cigarettes and vap@@ ing products , is being considered by ministers .
the first minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in " the coming months . "
nic@@ ola stur@@ geon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her government would " not hesitate " to act .
it comes as it emerged a vap@@ ing@@ -@@ related illness had claimed two more lives , bringing the total number of fat@@ alities to 11 .
vap@@ ing - which involves inhal@@ ing a mix typically made of nicotine , water , solvents and flav@@ ours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit , but its safety is still not entirely known .
but in the us , more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e@@ -@@ cigarettes . officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone .
the first deaths in florida and georgia were announced on tuesday and wednesday . currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness , with lives lost in eight states .
while most patients have reported a history of using products containing th@@ c , the psycho@@ active compound in can@@ nab@@ is , the patient who died in georgia on wednesday reported only " heavy nicotine vap@@ ing . "
the centres for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness , and has warned citizens against smoking e@@ -@@ cigarette products until more is known , particularly if modified or bought " off the street . "
the first minister has confirmed the scottish government was monit@@ origin developments in the us and elsewhere " closely , " following the loss of life that has been attributed to vap@@ ing .
she pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vap@@ ing being reported in europe .
" our approach has been a precau@@ tionary one , which is why in scotland we have already taken the stric@@ test regulatory approach in europe to vap@@ our products , " she said .
" the european tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e@@ -@@ cigarettes and ensures that e@@ -@@ liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful .
" the directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e@@ -@@ liquids .
" in scotland , we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations .
" in the coming months , we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vap@@ our products . "
she added : " it is important to stress , and for all of us to remember , that those devices are relatively new and , therefore , their impact continues to be studied . we do not yet fully understand what that impact is , which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious .
" that is perhaps a reason why e@@ -@@ cigarette use remains relatively low in scotland .
" we remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm .
" while we already have among the stric@@ test regimes on those products , if the evidence shows that further action is needed ... we will not hesitate to take it . "
cambodian court charges ex@@ iled politicians with rebellion
a cambodian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with plotting armed rebellion for planning to return from self@@ -@@ imposed exile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests .
the ph@@ no@@ m pen@@ h municipal court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the cambodia national rescue party to ou@@ st the government would also be risking a long prison term .
the returning party chiefs could be sent to prison for 15 to 30 years if found guilty , and their supporters could be sentenced to five to 10 years . even attending a rally or expressing support online could be considered plotting to top@@ ple the government , justice ministry spokesman chin mal@@ in was quoted as saying .
the court 's charges on thursday are the latest sal@@ vo in a political battle that has heated up since opposition leader sam rain@@ sy announced plans to return from more than three years of exile on nov@@ . 9 to seek a " restoration of democracy . "
nov@@ . 9 is cambodia 's independence day , celebrating when it obtained its freedom from france in 1953 .
" my calls to the people and the armed forces of # cambodia to rise up against the regime will continue until the regime has restored to the opposition its right to participate in the country 's political life including genuine elections , " sam rain@@ sy said on twitter earlier this week .
his opposition party was dissolved by the courts ahead of last year 's general election , ensuring that an increasingly authoritarian prime minister hun sen continued his four decades in power .
the party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the july 2018 election , and its dissolution was widely seen as being politically motivated , with hun sen 's ruling cambodian people 's party fearful that it could lose power in the polls .
hun sen 's government seems un@@ ner@@ ved by the planned return of opposition politicians , though the effort appears to be a qui@@ x@@ otic one , with sam rain@@ sy calling on cambodian workers in thailand to accompany him home in massive numbers .
officials have vowed to arrest sam rain@@ sy on his arrival , but there is speculation that cambodia may simply bar him from entry , which could even keep him from boarding a plane to the country if airlines are officially informed of such a ban . neighboring countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter from their territory .
however , the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers .
sam rain@@ sy went into exile in late 2015 to avoid a two@@ -@@ year prison sentence on charges of criminal defam@@ ation . other legal cases have since been lo@@ dged against him by the government .
other top party members fled into exile during a late 2017 crackdown on all opposition to hun sen , which included the arrest of the party 's co@@ -@@ founder , ke@@ m so@@ k@@ ha . he was charged with treason , based on his links to a u.s. pro@@ -@@ democracy organization , and is under strict house arrest .

"
she added : " i think it 's a broader idea of blocking the view , the outw@@ ard@@ -@@ looking view , to anywhere really . and that gesture of blocking the light . but i guess there is still this sort of glim@@ mer of hope , there is a slash in the canvas , and you can just see the sea on the horizon .

all works will be exhibited at mar@@ gate 's turner contemporary gallery , from 28 september to 12 january 2020 , and the winner of the turner prize 2019 will be announced at a ceremony on 3 december .

us sends troops , air defense systems to saudi arabia to deter iran attacks
the u.s. is sending a patriot missile battery , four ground@@ -@@ based radar systems , and 200 support troops to saudi arabia to deter iran 's increasingly aggressive behavior , officials announced thursday .
a tha@@ ad missile defense system and two additional patriot missile batteries are prepared to go if needed , the pentagon said .
" other countries have called out iranian mis@@ adventures in the region , and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce saudi arabia 's defense , " pentagon spokesman jonathan ho@@ ffman said .
last week , defense secretary mark es@@ per said more troops would deploy to the middle east as a " defensive " measure to help protect against attacks from iran .
es@@ per said the deployment was a first step toward addressing iran 's increasingly violent acts in the region -@@ - including this month 's drone attack on saudi arabian oil facilities -@@ - and he called on other nations to step up and condemn the attacks .
ir@@ an@@ -@@ backed hou@@ thi rebels in yemen claimed responsibility for the sept . 14 attack on the world 's largest oil processing plant and a major oil field , but the u.s. and saudi arabia blamed iran directly . iran has denied involvement in the attack .
" it is clear [ ... ] that the weapons used were ir@@ ani@@ an@@ -@@ produced and were not launched from yemen , " es@@ per said friday , noting that all signs indicate " iran was responsible for the attack . "
the purpose of deploying troops and resources is to " send a clear message that the united states supports our partners " and provide a " free flow of resources , " es@@ per said .
the u.s. calls on other countries to also " stand up and condemn the attacks , " as well as contribute capabilities , the secretary said .

germany reports landmark case of west nile virus
authorities are reporting the first known human case of west nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes in germany , a development apparently hast@@ ened by climate change .
the national disease control and tropical medicine centers said friday the person developed encephalitis but recovered after hospital treatment .
the virus originated in africa but has been spread north@@ ward by migratory birds and mosquitoes . there have been several outbreaks in southern and central europe in recent years . it is found in much of the u.@@ s .
jon@@ as schmid@@ t@@ -@@ chan@@ as@@ it of germany 's bern@@ hard no@@ cht institute tropical medicine center said that " the unusually warm summers of the last two years , triggered by climate change , apparently have contributed to wn@@ v establishing itself north of the alps . "

men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare as well without radiotherapy
men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare just as well without radiotherapy , a major study has found .
the findings , from the the largest ever trial examining those having surgery for the disease , could spare thousands from gru@@ elling treatment which can have distres@@ sing side@@ -@@ effects .
the royal mar@@ s@@ den study involved 1,@@ 400 men being treated for prostate cancer .
half were given immediate radiotherapy , which until now has been standard treatment to prevent the return of disease . the rest were monitored and only given radiotherapy if there were signs that disease had returned .
scientists found that five years later , there was almost no difference in disease recurrence between the two groups , with those who did not have treatment f@@ aring slightly better .
progression free survival was 85 per cent in the radiotherapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group .
there was a difference of around 1 per cent between the groups , after data was adjusted to take account of other factors .
the study , funded by cancer research uk , found those who had radiotherapy were twice as likely to suffer a worsening of urinary in@@ contin@@ ence , one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment .
one year after surgery 5.3 per cent of patients receiving radiotherapy suffered a deterioration , compared to 2.7 per cent who had standard care .

mac miller death : third man charged with drug offences
a third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the over@@ dose death of ra@@ pper mac miller .
steven walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxy@@ co@@ done pills lac@@ ed with fent@@ any@@ l that miller possessed before he died of an accidental over@@ dose last year of cocaine , alcohol and the powerful op@@ io@@ id .
walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man , cameron pet@@ tit , sold to miller .
ryan rea@@ vis , 36 , who was arrested in lake ha@@ vas@@ u city , arizona , this week is accused of serving as walter 's " runner , " who delivered the pills to pet@@ tit .
walter , who is on supervised release over a 2005 drug case , remains in custody .
a pittsburgh native whose real name was malcolm james my@@ ers mc@@ cor@@ mick , miller 's lyrics included frank discussion of his depression and drug use , earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip@@ -@@ hop .
he was also in a two@@ -@@ year relationship with ari@@ ana grande that ended earlier in 2018 . after his death she posted an affectionate video of him on her instagram page and released a song , thank u next , that lo@@ vingly mentioned him .
miller was one of several musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to a national wave of op@@ io@@ id abuse and over@@ doses .

the birth@@ day@@ -@@ suited shop@@ per 's identity remains unknown , though she appears to have been allowed to leave the premises after the impro@@ mp@@ tu pe@@ ep show .

in another case of compelled supermarket n@@ ud@@ ity this week , a british man , steve white@@ hur@@ st , was forced to expose himself to security guards after they spotted a mysterious " bul@@ ge " in his pants . he hadn 't stolen anything .
" i can 't help the way i 'm made , " white@@ hur@@ st told the sun .
